Just a few of the things I read, watched, whatever this week.

_Online:_



	
  * **_[How Many Ideas Do You Show Your Clients?](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/12/28/discuss-how-many-ideas-do-you-show-clients/)_ - Smashing - Graham Smith**
A good article, especially for Smashing, about the importance of reading your client before you give them too many choices during the creative process; showing off our imaginations to the wrong person does nothing but serve our egos, but doing so to the right person can instill confidence. My favorite part, "In my experience, we are getting lazy as communicators, trying to deal with all aspects of life — business and personal — via email and text messages." I see this daily, but I wouldn't fault e-mail -- I blame the lazy and inconsiderate author as well as the lazy and illiterate reader. It's important to communicate in a way you'll be understood, but communicating with the written word is hardly new and anyone can do it effectively if they make the effort.



	
  * **_[Time Management: The Pickle Jar Theory](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pickle/) _- A List Apart - Jeremy Wright**
This one's been waiting to be read for at least a month because I couldn't find the time. It's a good read on establishing and addressing priority tasks and scheduling your day around those. It took me a while to come to one of the same conclusions that e-mails were rarely immediate problems and could be wound in between other to-do items.



	
  * **_[It Takes Leadership](http://www.entrepreneur.com/management/leadership/article204500.html)_ - Entrepreneur**** - Michael Sanibel**
Simply a great post that really hit home for me. I often reflect on the importance of leadership in a business environment and what goes awry when it's missing from the equation. So much in business and teams has to come from the top.



	
  * _**[Military use of consumer technology](http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15063872) - **__**The Econo**_**mist**_
_I love The Economist -- I think it's one of the best producers of content around, but I wasn't under the impression that this was anything new. Wasn't Saddam rumored to have bought PlayStation 2 by the truckload for missile guidance a decade ago? I also thought that the public was given GPS from the military, not the other way around. Either way, interesting read.

  * **[Dollhouse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135300/)**
My wife and I just finished our month-long hiatus from TV, so I finally got to catch up on Joss Whedon's latest dumped-from-Fox-before-its-time show. _(A lot of people are still bitter about [Firefly](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/), and I'm one of them.) _It really is a fantastic show and I'm sad to see it go.

	
  * [**Dragon Age: Origins**](http://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Age-Origins-Pc/dp/B001IK1BWC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1262647418&sr=1-2)
I spent way too much time on this game over the week -- probably in the range of 10 hours or so. It's an incredible RPG that draws on a lot of sensibilities established in MMOs with a very engaging storyline.

	
  * **[Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/)**
The bulk of my free time has been spent on a Ruby on Rails tutorial. I'm really eager to learn more about the programming framework, but if the past has taught me anything, marathon cramming isn't the best way to retain large amounts of new information.
