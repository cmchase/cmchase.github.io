I've been taking an short break from digital productivity and I've found it a bit difficult to get back into the "work 12 hours a day" mood. I absolutely love working on the web but I'm sure most would agree that it's a lot of work to keep up with the industry. There really aren't enough hours in the day, which (in my weaker moments) leaves me feeling like throwing up my hands and getting off the grid altogether by moving into a woodland cabin.


But then I remember just how creeped out by spiders I get (I'm pretty sure just about any cabin in the woods is going to be spider-laden) and I suddenly have renewed interested in sitting behind a desk and reading blogs all night.
