What's happening to us? Did I do something wrong? You've always been interested in others, but I used to feel so welcomed when I showed up.

I don't know when or why it happened, but now it seems like you've only got eyes for new people. Was it something I tweeted?

Now it seems like I have to work extra hard to come back -- did you forget about me, the existing user? I see that there's a little box with a jQuery function attached, which is neat, but I still feel a bit slighted. I know you guys don't see eye-to-eye, but maybe you could learn a thing or two from Facebook. They manage to bring new people to the party without ignoring the rest of us.

Look, let's be honest here... I'd much rather get it on with you but Facebook is in this relationship for the long haul. Is there any way we can compromise?

I know it's really low-res, but I don't think I'm asking for too much and you still look incredible.
