I love video games. I'm pretty sure I've said it before, but I'm saying it again to get it out there. But, as a homeowner, husband and father working in an field where I have to constantly expand my skillset to keep up, I don't get to play video games very often.

For a few years now, I've had to rely on game journalists and podcasts to help me enjoy gaming vicariously. It's pretty normal to develop some favorites -- personalities and voices (both verbal and written) that I like more than others. It just so happens that a good number of them have moved on to [Polygon.com](http://polygon.com) -- yet-to-launch as of this writing, but it's going live any day now.

They've put together [an incredible video series](http://www.polygon.com/press-reset) documenting the planning and development of the site, that I highly recommend watching. I think anyone interested in online journalism, new media reporting and (of course) video games would get a lot out it.

*edit*

Updated the link to Press Reset as The Verge is no longer hosting it.
