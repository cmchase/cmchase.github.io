My wife sent me a message today that read, "Mia just pooped on the potty." Being that I'm 1) stupid, and 2) a proud parent, I told my friends at the office to the expected amount of ambivalence. Samantha and I have joked about how odd it is that we casually talk about another human being's bodily functions, but now we're practically high-fiving each other because our daughter took a shit in a designated container. Parenthood turns otherwise reasonable people in real weirdos.

Speaking of pooping in a little plastic toilet, Don Mattrick has left Microsoft for Zynga just a few weeks after leading the Xbox team into a minefield at E3. Polygon has [a fantastic write-up](http://www.polygon.com/2013/7/2/4487930/9-things-to-know-about-don-mattricks-move-from-xbox-one-to-zynga) on the topic, but the extremely short version is that Microsoft really, really botched their messaging at a recent gaming expo and then Mattrick went on to dig the hole deeper with some follow-up comments. 

The fact that someone is leaving Microsoft isn't that surprising, but to move to Zynga is like escaping a fire by boarding a sinking ship -- I'm not sure what to think about Zynga's stock [going up like 11%](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/07/02/tech-stocks-zynga/2482079/) in response. (If you've never heard any insight on Zynga, here's [a great Reddit AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fpbv1/i_was_one_of_the_520_people_laid_off_by_zynga/) from one of the people they recently laid off.)

For record, I'm patiently waiting to see if Microsoft can sort things out for the Xbox One -- with indie developer support being my biggest concern -- but I'm no fan of Zynga and they can continue to sink for all I care.
