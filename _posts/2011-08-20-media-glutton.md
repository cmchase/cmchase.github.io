I've been knocking around a blog post idea for the past week or so about how much media and information I consume. I wanted to talk about how my consumption compares to people just 20 years ago -- books, music, articles, movies, television, advertisements, games, etc.

Well, this isn't that post. It's a heady topic and I don't feel I could do it justice.

So this is the post to say that I had the idea, and it was a good one, but it's not going to happen right now.
