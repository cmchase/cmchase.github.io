We all wish we knew then what we know now. What would you say to yourself at the start of your current career? "[Dear Past Me](http://www.corychase.com/tag/dear-past-me/)" is a series of posts where I explore just that.

It's a sad thing, but there will be times when you're less appreciated for being thoughtful and creative than for being able to perform a task others can't. [Accept it for what it is and let it go](http://www.corychase.com/dear-past-me-dont-hate/). It's a part of working for someone else and it helps keep the lights on...


## Just Don't Turn Off Your Brain

Sure, it's easier to get through mundane tasks when you're on autopilot: washing dishes, digging ditches and typing out 3 pages of faxed text because a client refuses to send an e-mail all come to mind. That's okay -- listen to some music or a podcast or whatever keeps you sane -- but if you stop thinking for yourself then you'll eventually run into problems.

	
  * Big knife fall into the sink? Stop washing and fish it out.

	
  * Is the hole starting to smell like natural gas? Stop digging and put out that cigarette.

	
  * Giant 'F-bomb scrawled across the page? Stop typing and contact that e-mail adverse client.


We can't always be presented with interesting problems and we won't always be learning new things, but firing a few extra synapses will keep you from making stupid mistakes and looking like a jackass.
