Just last week I was telling my team leader about my design process for difficult problems: I examine the task from all the angles I can, think about possible solutions and then I go do something else for a while. Luckily he didn't think me a lazy bastard and even knew what I meant by "shower epiphanies" - being struck with inspiration during moments of mental idleness (while driving, doing yardwork or in the shower).

It was a nice coincidenceÂ that I saw _Jonah Lehrer's [You Know More Than You Know](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/you-know-more-than-you-know/)_ this morning.
