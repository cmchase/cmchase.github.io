<h1>Ahoy, GitHub!</h1>

<p>My name is Cory Chase and I'm from St. Petersburg, FL. I work as the Lead Web Dev, UI Designer and User Advocate for Loop Management, and I'm convinced that I'm a solid fit for your Internal Tools team.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this, your time valuable and I think I can convince you I'm a good fit, too.</p>

<p>Here you can find my <a href="/works">portfolio</a> as well as my <a href="/assets/media/cory-chase-resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<ul>
	<li>I'm self-motivated and passionately take ownership of the projects and features I work on.</li>

	<li>I have extensive experience in web design, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. While I'm proficient with LESS, my production experience with SCSS is limited to the work I did during <a href="http://r12.railsrumble.com/entries/340-all-these-images" target="_blank">Rails Rumble 2012</a>. As for CoffeeScript, I'm new to the JS abstraction but I've been making progress with it.</li>

	<li>I fill a lot of roles at Loop so I'm adept at juggling priorities and multiple deadlines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hiring &amp; Software</h2>
<p>One of the many hats I wear is that of hiring manager for web developers. The engineering team here is lean with fewer than 20 members, and the web dev team I lead is even leaner with a max of 4. This isn't because we don't have enough work to go around, it's because we're very finicky about who we bring on board.</p>


<h3>Problem 1:</h3>
<p>Of the 50+ resumes I'd get in a month, fewer than 10 would even remotely match the requirements of our posting. I'm sure the issue is with people just carpet-bombing applications, but there has to be a way software can help.</p>

<p>What if the dated notion of a resume was completely removed from the process and was replaced with questionnaires and a listing of skills? LinkedIn does this fairly well, and we all know recruiters are been able to pester/identify candidates with it.</p>

<p>No, what if a hiring company had to go through the same process for their listing rather than a copied/pasted Word doc? This would give software an even better starting point to match people and companies together. It would also allow for the system to warn users that they're trying to apply for a position they're not qualified.</p>

<h3>Problem 2:</h3>
<p>Applicants often over-inflate their knowledge. What if users could opt-in to letting GitHub 'verify' them in a specific technology by checking their commit history? This wouldn't necessarily help for HR or support positions, but it seems pretty straight-forward for developers.</p>

<h4>Two things:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Access to private repos would be extremely valuable for the verification. As an example, my public GitHub profile lists completely different technologies than my private activity would.</li>
	
	<li>What if this idea could be applied to designers as well? My commit activity dips in the weeks that I focus on design. Perhaps if GitHub saw that I was committing tons of PSDs and BMMLs then the system could either ask me or poll the commit messages to figure out what I was working on.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Problem 3:</h3>
<p>If I'm lucky, those 50 resumes a month might yield 3 or 4 applicants I'm actually interested in learning more about. Before picking up the phone, I checkout portfolios, troll Twitter feeds and I Google names and email addresses. We've got a tight-knit crew in the engineering department, I'm looking for insight on personalities as much as I am samples of work.</p>

<p>What if a system could summarize some of this for me, expanding on what Klout does?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tweets a lot about Justin Bieber and CoD</li>
	<li>3 matching names found in area on MugShots.com</li>
	<li>Email address found on StackOverflow</li>
</ul>

<p>One last thing; what if that summary was also made available to the applicant? Knowing how others perceive you sounds pretty valuable and creates a new level of transparency for everyone involved.</p>

<h3>Fun Fact</h3>
<p>There's a porn star named Cory Chase and I've gotten some saucy emails that were meant for her. In comparison, I'm extremely happy with the career path I chose.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Product</h2>

<p>We just launched our first native iOS application this summer and it was one of my favorite products to work on. (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smartlane/id686173091?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a>)</p>

<p>It was a major departure from the normal .NET environment we were used to, and our two-man team had to ramp up really quickly in Objective-C and Xcode because of a very tight deadline. I had to dive into everything from design constraints and retina asset generation to writing View Delegates and custom button Classes.</p>

<p>It was a fantastic experience, but one of the biggest revelations for me was just how far web development has come in the 10 years I've been in the industry. Xcode and Objective-C don't do a very good job of separating programming logic from the presentation layer. It really reminded me of the days of slicing PSDs out into table layouts -- the design to code process felt very rigid and iteration was sometimes a challenge.</p>

<p>It was a relief when I got to building the support site for the application. (<a href="http://autoloop.us/SmartLane">autoloop.us/SmartLane</a>) I did absolutely everything for the site, design, dev and copy; and going back to HTML, CSS and JavaScript felt like cheating after a long stint in Objective-C.</p>

<h2>On a Personal Note</h2>

<p>I love to spend time with my wife and daughter when I'm not at a computer. I wouldn't have ever guessed that I'd grow up to be a family man; I don't think I ever held a child before my daughter was born.</p>

<p>Toddlers are surprisingly time-consuming, but I also enjoy reading and listening to podcasts. I'm almost embarrassed by the amount of Sci-Fi/Fantasy I've read (I just finished a Brandon Sanderson binge) but I'll proudly tell anyone that they should listen to 99% Invisible, ShopTalk Show and Planet Money.</p>

<p>Something else I wouldn't announce in a crowded elevator is that I've watch all of the modern Star Trek series several times and I'm thinking about watching them again in chronological order by  Stardate.</p>
