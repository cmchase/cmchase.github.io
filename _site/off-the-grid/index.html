<p>I&#39;ve been taking an short break from digital productivity and I&#39;ve found it a bit difficult to get back into the &quot;work 12 hours a day&quot; mood. I absolutely love working on the web but I&#39;m sure most would agree that it&#39;s a lot of work to keep up with the industry. There really aren&#39;t enough hours in the day, which (in my weaker moments) leaves me feeling like throwing up my hands and getting off the grid altogether by moving into a woodland cabin.</p>

<p>But then I remember just how creeped out by spiders I get (I&#39;m pretty sure just about any cabin in the woods is going to be spider-laden) and I suddenly have renewed interested in sitting behind a desk and reading blogs all night.</p>
