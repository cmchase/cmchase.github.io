<p>Cory, if all goes well then you should be reading this post from nearly 7 years in your future. Don&#39;t go thinking I&#39;m <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Brown">Doc Brown</a> or anything - I just scheduled the post date for 2003. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m the first to come up with this, but it turned out to be pretty easy to do thanks to a huge oversight from the WordPress developers.</p>

<p>So, I was reading an e-mail from my brother-in-law James a bit ago <em>(spoiler alert: you totally marry Samantha)</em> where he was talking about his friend recently graduating from design school. This guy&#39;s a bit nervous about doing design for a living, which is understandable, but it got me thinking about what kind of advice I&#39;d pass on to a newbie. I came up with some good tips but then it hit me: this guy is my competition. Why in the world would I want to make things harder for myself by making them easier for him?</p>

<p>Screw. That.</p>

<p>As you&#39;re reading this you should have just started to work on the web professionally and I&#39;m going to be sending back some tips to make life a bit easier for the both of us. I&#39;m not going to do them all at once --Â I&#39;d imagine your mind is fairly well blown already -- I&#39;m just going to leave you with one tidbit this time around. It&#39;s a big one, so pay attention:</p>

<h2>Keep learning new things.</h2>

<p>You can&#39;t go all complacent just because you got a web design job. You will never learn enough if you limit yourself to 40 hours a week, especially in a production-oriented office -- there&#39;s just too much out there. (Well, not as much back then as there are now, but there&#39;s enough to keep you busy.)</p>

<p>But wait, what&#39;s &quot;enough&quot;?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know and wish I did. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really quantifiable. Some might say &quot;enough&quot; is what it takes to get the job done, but I&#39;d ask how well the job turned out. Some might say it&#39;s being able to immediately solve any problem that ever comes your way, but that&#39;s completely unrealistic (without a fixed quantity of problems). I&#39;m willing to bet it&#39;s somewhere in between...</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let yourself feel overwhelmed or daunted with information overload - web design is really tough, especially as a generalist. I&#39;d suggest dabbling with something new for 30 minutes a day. If you get bored with a subject, move on to something else. Just keep at it and we&#39;ll be fine.</p>
