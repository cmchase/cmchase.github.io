<p>I recently held a couple of client training sessions for a website I built using <a href="http://expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a>. I put a lot of thought and energy into anticipating their needs while building the site, and I spent just as much again when preparing their training materials.</p>

<p>The training sessions went really well – there were a couple of supporting e-mails, but the client hit the ground running and had no trouble working on their site. I&#39;m not trying to toot my own horn – I&#39;m just working my way to my point:</p>

<h2>Effective Communication Requires Consideration</h2>

<p>My wife teaches 5th grade and when she starts talking pedagogy my eyes glaze over and I go to my happy place. <em>(I&#39;m totally joking, sweetie. That&#39;s my thinking face.) _I am not cut out to be a teacher and my capacity as an instructor isn&#39;t why the training went well.</em>
_</p>

<p>What I am, though, is really considerate. Beyond good manners and letting traffic into my lane, I try to put myself in the shoes of others. <em>What do they know, think and feel?</em> I think this kind of empathy is crucial in not only better understanding others, but in communicating ideas (especially complex ones).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t always get this right. Sometimes I overestimate my audience and get too jargony, others I miss just how much they understand and explain something they already knew. This can leave me feeling or looking like a jackass, but that&#39;s okay – I just apologize (if necessary) and change my tact, whether in written or verbal exchanges.</p>
