<p>I recently posted about how <a href="/ios-brain-leak/">my brain leaks out all the Objective-C I know</a> if I go too long without using it, which is barely an exaggeration,  so I made some time in my day this past Friday to clear out a last-minute bug. In that same post, I mentioned how I feel in love with NSNotificationCenter, which I used to try to handle a bug where the UI gets all wonky if the the user taps the VIN Search button while the user had focus on the SearchBar. (I&#39;m simply disabling the VIN Search button until the SearchBar resigns first responder.)</p>

<p>Tapping the VIN Search button while the SearchBar had first responder would cause the SearchBar to scroll up behind the UINavigationController.</p>

<p>Well, QA got really creative and decided to see what would happen if they tapped and held the VIN Scan button and then tapped the SearchBar. The solution wasn&#39;t really that complicated, but it took me a bit to figure out what I needed to do and  NSNotificationCenter helped me out again:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>UIBarButtonItems don&#39;t seem give  access to the control&#39;s events, so I had convert it to a UIButton.</p></li>
<li><p>On TouchDown I send a message to Notification Center so the nested view can disable the SearchBar.</p></li>
<li><p>On TouchUpInside and TouchUpOutside I send another to reenable the SearchBar, but only on the former do I invoke the method I made out of the old VIN Scan&#39;s IBAction.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This approach really doesn&#39;t feel right because I&#39;ve now got 3 observers on the child view for the touch events and 2 on the parent for disabling the VIN Scan button -- it really does have a weird smell to it -- but everything I&#39;ve read seems to point to NSNotificationCenter as the way go. I really don&#39;t know of a better way but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll kick myself in the ass about this solution on some far-off date.</p>
