<p>I think one of the best ways to capture the interest of customers is to <em>gasp</em> <em>be interesting</em>. I know, it seems like a bunch of crap -- why would anyone want to <em>enjoy</em> reading what a company has to say? What would we do with all the dry, faceless corporate text that&#39;s out there? (Probably the same thing we&#39;re doing now; ignoring it.)</p>

<h2>The Exceptions Should Be the Rule</h2>

<p>My wife and I ordered a gift online and I was delighted by the auto-responder:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Cory,</p>

<p>Thank you for ordering Zoomdoggle&#39;s BuckyBalls. You did the right thing. I mean, not if you were planning on getting anything done the day they arrive, but if you&#39;re the type who likes fun stuff, whiling away the hours, and magnets, BuckyBalls are buckets of fun.</p>

<p>One thing to know: BuckyBalls come with no instructions—&quot;figuring &#39;em out is part of the fun!&quot;—but periodically we&#39;ll be posting how-to&#39;s to our blog, Zoomdoggle.com. Keep en eye out.</p>

<p>Last but not least, odds are your friends are going to want a set as soon as they see yours. So long as they don&#39;t want to rub them against pacemakers or hand them to children (we&#39;re included a complete set of warnings in your package, but some things you just can&#39;t say enough), we figure any friend of yours is a friend of ours. Slip them product code &quot;GetBucked.&quot; That&#39;ll give them 10% off and feel like they&#39;ve just been high-fived by Santa. How fun is that?</p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s all. We&#39;ll be dropping them in the mail in 3-7 business days and sending them out USPS (You&#39;ll get an email from us when Mr. Postman picks up your order.) U.S. order should take about 3-4 days from the time they are shipped and International orders about 6-10.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy.</p>

<p>PS: Feel free to email me with any questions, concerns, or wholesale
inquiries at <a href="mailto:GetBuckyBalls@gmail.com">GetBuckyBalls@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>They already got our money, but they still went out of their way to improve the experience. A few things happened as a result:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For the first time ever, I read one of these messages line-for-line</p></li>
<li><p>I really liked the personality, attention to detail and that someone &quot;signed&quot; it, so I felt better about giving them our money</p></li>
<li><p>I grew interested in the company and bookmarked their blog. Chances are I&#39;ll want to give them <em>more</em> of our money</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This kind of crafted message wouldn&#39;t work for something like Amazon or iTunes (not that a little personality would hurt them) but I think it works really well for Zoomdoggle.com.</p>
