<p>I love video games. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve said it before, but I&#39;m saying it again to get it out there. But, as a homeowner, husband and father working in an field where I have to constantly expand my skillset to keep up, I don&#39;t get to play video games very often.</p>

<p>For a few years now, I&#39;ve had to rely on game journalists and podcasts to help me enjoy gaming vicariously. It&#39;s pretty normal to develop some favorites -- personalities and voices (both verbal and written) that I like more than others. It just so happens that a good number of them have moved on to <a href="http://polygon.com">Polygon.com</a> -- yet-to-launch as of this writing, but it&#39;s going live any day now.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve put together <a href="http://www.polygon.com/press-reset">an incredible video series</a> documenting the planning and development of the site, that I highly recommend watching. I think anyone interested in online journalism, new media reporting and (of course) video games would get a lot out it.</p>
