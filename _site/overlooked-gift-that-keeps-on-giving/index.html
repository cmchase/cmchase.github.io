<p>Years ago I played World of Warcraft quite a bit --  back when I had considerably more free time. I&#39;ve long stopped playing, but I still look back on it fondly. It was rarely the game itself that held my attention -- it was the people and social aspects that kept me coming back so often (as most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game">MMO</a> players would agree).</p>

<p>I was part of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_guild">guild</a> called &quot;Bad Mojo&quot; and we got together 3 or 4 times a week for several hours to tackle in-game content. _(Far too often for my then-fiancée&#39;s liking and, in retrospect, far too often for me to have any other hobbies.) _They were a great group, many of whom I&#39;d consider good friends, and committed enough to the game to have a web site. I wouldn&#39;t openly say so at the time, but it was atrocious:</p>

<h2>omg ur site sux lol</h2>

<p>I didn&#39;t want to be insulting, especially since I didn&#39;t want to rebuild the site myself (I was too busy playing), so I offered to make them a logo to spruce things up a bit. I didn&#39;t spend too much time on it, maybe a handful of hours (again, I had a game to play), but I was satisfied with the results. Below is the final logo I ended up providing:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2009/12/bad-mojo-logo-full.png" alt="I considered this to be the &quot;full&quot; logo."></p>

<p>I soon realized that the guild&#39;s &quot;web guy&quot; wasn&#39;t going to do anything with the logo I made, and if he did it probably wouldn&#39;t turn out very well (he was more of a coder). I didn&#39;t want it to go to waste, so I set out to make a number of banners for the existing site. I quickly found that the square logo wasn&#39;t going to work in the slender masthead, so I made a variation:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2009/12/bad-mojo-logo-slim.png" alt="This was a more slim version of the logo for use on the existing site."></p>

<p>Normally, I wouldn&#39;t be able to do this kind of thing for a client but it&#39;s not like we had any marketing concerns.</p>

<p>To create the banners I used screen shots from the game and a WoW model viewer to pose and export the foreground characters. In the end I came up with about 10 or so, 4 of which can be seen below:</p>

<h2>To Be Greeted with a Resounding &#39;meh&#39;</h2>

<p>I knew it wasn&#39;t high-caliber work or anything but I was shocked by the lukewarm, if not indifferent, reception. Didn&#39;t they see what was there before? How could they not care about this kind of thing?</p>

<p>I went on to use the logo in the handful of videos I made of our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_%28gaming%29">raids</a>. I really thought the logo brought a lot to the table, but I was no longer surprised when there wasn&#39;t much feedback. <em>(I think I did the videos just as an excuse to use the logo.)</em></p>

<h2>What I Got Out of It</h2>

<p>I never really felt slighted by their response (or lack thereof) -- I was glad to give what I could to a bunch of great folks. My biggest takeaway was a very strong reminder: the general public doesn&#39;t think about design.  If they&#39;re even aware of it, it&#39;s on a much more subconscious level.</p>

<p>While I&#39;ve long, long since parted ways with the guild, I find it extremely satisfying that <a href="http://badmojo.guildomatic.com/">Bad Mojo of Garona</a> is still using the logo I made for them over 3 years ago. I may not agree with what they say on their site, and their use of Outer Glow is criminal, but I&#39;d really like to think that I&#39;ve contributed something that adds to their sense of community -- even if they&#39;re oblivious to it.</p>
