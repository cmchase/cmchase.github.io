<p>Thanks for your interest. I think we have a lot to offer each other.</p>

<p>Of course you have questions, let&#39;s chat and get to know each other. Here&#39;s a list of references.</p>

<p>You&#39;d like to do a background check? Sure, I understand. No, that&#39;s cool, I&#39;m not offended -- due diligence and all that.</p>
