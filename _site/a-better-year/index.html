<p>I&#39;m not one for making New Year&#39;s Resolutions, but I&#39;ve been doing a lot of navel gazing the past few months and I may as well articulate a conclusion I came to.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not out to quit a vice, exercise more, donate more blood or whatever&#39;s itemized on some list pinned up on the fridge. Lists are fine things, they help me function on a daily basis, but my big goal for the foreseeable future isn&#39;t something I can put to paper with a little checkbox for motivation&#39;s sake.</p>

<p><em>I want to be better.</em></p>
