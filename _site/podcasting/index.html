<p>My pal Dean is a smart guy.</p>

<p>For as long as I&#39;ve known him, he&#39;s been paid to talk to people. From college professor to the book lecture thing he does these days, his jobs have involved going up in front of a crowd. Now he&#39;s looking to do it from the comfort of his living room with podcasting.</p>

<p>Let me be up front here -- I love podcasts, so my eyes got all big and saucer-like when he shared his plans. I just looked at my phone: <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/">Planet Money</a>, <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/podcast/">The Bombcast</a>, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks">TEDTalks</a> and <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/">UIE Brain Sparks</a> are just some of the 17 feeds I listen to weekly. Many come and go depending on mood, but I hover around a core dozen or so. (I listened to far, far more back when I wasn&#39;t in meetings most of the day.)</p>

<p>That being said, I hereby qualify myself as an expert in things I find interesting and would like to make a few recommendations to the would-be podcaster:</p>

<h2>1) Bring a Friend</h2>

<p>Josh and Chuck from <a href="http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/hsw-shows/stuff-you-should-know-podcast.htm">Stuff You Should Know</a> are incredible. There&#39;s something familiar about the way they interact that&#39;s comforting -- so much so that my wife insisted on listening to their podcast while she was in labor last September.</p>

<p>Their chemistry is fantastic and they&#39;ve got a great repertoire, but I think it&#39;s their ability to make the listener feel like they&#39;re part of the conversation that really makes their show a success.</p>

<h2>2) Be Engaging</h2>

<p>Duh. However, the truth of it is that I&#39;ve heard otherwise brilliant and interesting people turn into bores on mic. For the most part, it&#39;s not what people say, but how they say it.</p>

<p>Roman Mars of <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible</a> has this way of making you feel like you&#39;re sharing something with him throughout the episode. He&#39;s also got this kind of amused warmth in his closing that leaves you feeling good about the time spent listening to the show.</p>

<h2>3) Keep a Good Pace</h2>

<p>It would be criminal if I didn&#39;t mention Ira Glass with <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast">This American Life</a>, and here&#39;s as good a place as any. Ira&#39;s one of the best hosts I&#39;ve ever heard for so many reasons, but for here I&#39;ll say that he moves from story-to-story with elegance and his spoken words-per-minute is great, if a little on the high-end. With so many options available, listeners are going to bounce if there&#39;s too much meandering.</p>

<h2>4) Edit</h2>

<p>Are things rambling along? Going on about something no one would possibly find interesting? Did you have to get up to answer the door because the UPS guy showed up?</p>

<p>Edit shit out. Really, don&#39;t hesitate to trim out inane junk. Time is short and attention spans are even shorter.</p>

<p>To add, you might also consider editing to create mood and pacing. <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">RadioLab</a> is an incredible show that uses creative editing like no other. The amount of work involved isn&#39;t for everyone, but the results are undeniable. (See also <a href="http://alifewellwasted.com/">A Life Well Wasted</a> by Robert Ashley. It was fantastic, if short-lived.)</p>

<p>There are exceptions. I&#39;ve listened to a few podcasts that put their recordings up raw, but they rarely last long in my queue. The strongest reason I put up with unedited or meandering podcasts? I really, really liked the hosts.</p>

<h2>5) Be Likable</h2>

<p>Obviously, right? Not really -- nothing gets a podcast dropped from my feed faster than disliking a regular host. Go ahead and be a jackass, it might even be entertaining, but keep in mind that the listener needs to connect with you. The short of it is this: people tend to overlook more faults if they like you, this is true at parties, in the office and for voices in an earbud.</p>

<h2>An Unqualified Reductionist</h2>

<p>Just a minute ago I qualified myself as an expert in what I like -- I lied, I&#39;m not. I can tell you what I like and why I like it, but I think I&#39;ve barely scratched the surface of what makes a podcast any good. It&#39;s really not a comprehensive list and I make no claims to its value, but I can safely say this: content can get me to listen to a show once, but the shows I stay subscribed to all do at least 4 of the 5 above.</p>
