<p>I went to the first-ever Front-End Design Conference Workshop to get some insight on how <a href="https://twitter.com/nickawalsh">@nickawalsh</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/drewbarontini">@drewbarontini</a> do things over at <a href="http://envylabs.com/">Envy Labs</a>. They were great! They kept things going at a good pace and were super-patient with my constant badgering. They laid out a lot of their processes and the thinking behind their methodologies; I don&#39;t agree with a couple of their approaches -- I&#39;m sure our opinions are colored by the stacks we work in (.NET vs. Rails) and team composition -- but seeing how they do things was invaluable.</p>

<p>Something I absolutely took away from the workshop and implemented as soon as I got back to the office was the use of font icons. They pulled up <a href="http://icomoon.io/">icomoon.io</a> and demoed a quick SVG conversion. My mind was just blown because it totally solves a problem I&#39;ve had coming up at Loop. (We&#39;re about to update all of our icons to a new set to match Subaru&#39;s branding collateral.)</p>

<p>I wanted to allow for some size and color variations for our CSS background icons without compromising IE8 support, but adding/maintaining hundreds of images would be an enormous pain in the ass. We&#39;ve also been looking into a way to generate sprite sheets to keep the server requests to a minimum, but that&#39;s its own maintenance hassle and the file would have been enormous.</p>

<p>The workshop topic couldn&#39;t have come at a better time -- font icons really has saved the day and I feel like an idiot for not having thought of it myself. I looked into the technique a year or two ago, but couldn&#39;t use it for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We still needed to support IE7. (Dropping it didn&#39;t happen until about 6 months ago.)</p></li>
<li><p>We were locked into a colorful icon set full of gradients. (Fonts really only work for flat, monochromatic icons.)</p></li>
<li><p>The solutions I looked at weren&#39;t extensible or maintainable. For a constantly growing and changing app, this was a big deal breaker.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I spent a bit of time on Monday testing the waters and converting our huge library of icons to SVG for use as a font. We currently have something in the area of 60 actively-used icons that I have to replace, but I wanted to make the font more future-proof by including more icons than we currently needed.We may have gone overboard by allowing for 300+ icons/characters in the font, and I&#39;m sure we could have shaved off a couple hundred kilobytes in file size if we kept to just the icons we needed right away, but I needed to err on the side of flexibility.</p>

<p>I ran into some hurdles with getting the font to consistently render well on Windows Chrome as well as some small alignment issues, but a small browser prefix and line-height adjustments did the trick. I&#39;m really pumped about the change and convinced our CPO to let the update in for our next release. Thanks again to <a href="https://twitter.com/nickawalsh">@nickawalsh</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/drewbarontini">@drewbarontini</a> for the killer workshop!</p>
