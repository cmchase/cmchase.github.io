<p>I&#39;ve been knocking around a blog post idea for the past week or so about how much media and information I consume. I wanted to talk about how my consumption compares to people just 20 years ago -- books, music, articles, movies, television, advertisements, games, etc.</p>

<p>Well, this isn&#39;t that post. It&#39;s a heady topic and I don&#39;t feel I could do it justice.</p>

<p>So this is the post to say that I had the idea, and it was a good one, but it&#39;s not going to happen right now.</p>
