<p>In response to <a href="/mobile-phones-suck/">Mobile Phones Suck</a>, I&#39;m in love with my cell phone and all it took was a fried motherboard.</p>

<p>About a week ago I woke up and my Evo 3D wouldn&#39;t turn on. I tried everything I could, including various chargers, battery swaps and weirdo button combinations. No luck.</p>

<p>I took it to Sprint where I learned the the motherboard just up and died from no fault of my own. They didn&#39;t have any more 3Ds in stock, so the manager was really flexible and gave me a choice between a loaner phone while they reordered or replacing it with either the Evo Design or Motorola Photon.</p>

<p>(To summarize the differences: the Design has the same 1.2GHz dual-core processor and 5MP camera as the 3D, but without the unused 3D gimmick. The Photon has an 8MP camera with a 1GHz dual-core.)</p>

<p>I went with the Photon and I&#39;m really glad I did.</p>

<h2>Sidetone!</h2>

<p>That&#39;s right, the Photon has sidetone and I absolutely love it! Having actual conversations on my phone is now a treat.</p>

<p>I let a couple co-workers try it and they both agreed that it feels more intimate and warm, but my wife responded with wet-blanket-indifference. (We&#39;re a married couple. It&#39;s what we do.) A couple days later she borrowed my phone to make a few calls and she changed her tune -- she now says calls just sound better on the Photon, like they&#39;re more clear than her 3D.</p>

<p>Sidetone will be a requirement for all of my phones from here on out. I&#39;ve read that Apple introduced it with iPhone 4S, which probably means it&#39;ll probably be standard on all smartphones in the near future.</p>
