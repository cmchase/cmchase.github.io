<p>I&#39;ve found myself working in iOS again for the past few days for the first time in over a month. Every time I go back to it after a long hiatus I discover just how much Objective-C I&#39;ve forgotten since the last time. </p>

<p>We&#39;re just about ready to submit our app to the store and I&#39;m moving on to an entirely unrelated set of projects for the next couple of months, so I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be getting back to iOS development again. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll go through the adjustment pains then too, but here are a couple things I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t forget:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#39;s not the syntax that&#39;s challenging, StackOverflow is a lifesaver, it&#39;s thinking about the code in a very different way. (The first day back in Objective-C involves a lot of profanity.)</p></li>
<li><p>You can&#39;t even open the Storyboard without committing a change and Git conflict resolution is a major pain. (Yields more profanity.)</p></li>
<li><p>Writing delegates is a process, which is probably why I&#39;ve really come to appreciate NSNotificationCenter for basic events between views.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Doing iOS dev is an interesting experience and it&#39;s a nice break from the .NET norm, but I find myself wondering how the headaches would be different if we went with a JavaScript solution and Phonegap or Titanium instead.</p>
