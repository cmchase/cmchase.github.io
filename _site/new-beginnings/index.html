<p>In about 12 hours I start my new position as a web developer with the engineering team at <a href="http://www.loopfx.com/">Loop Management, LLC</a>. I&#39;d been with <a href="http://www.digitaleel.com/">Digital Eel, Inc</a> as a jack of all trades web designer/developer for just over 7 years -- they treated me very well and I was lucky to be a part of their  family -- so I feel like I&#39;m leaving behind a long history of familiarity and comfort.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very excited about learning new things and meeting new people -- overall I&#39;m extremely grateful  for the opportunity, but I&#39;m still a bit nervous -- 7 years is a long time, especially in the tech/knowledge industry, so I worry about a bunch of stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What kind of skill gaps do I have? Will I be thrown to the fire? Will I be over-coddled?</p></li>
<li><p>What if I say the wrong thing and upset someone? Will I be branded for life as a jerk?</p></li>
<li><p>What if any of the millions of little habits I&#39;ve developed over the years is a taboo there? Are headphones considered rude? Is it bad form to surf for tech news during lunch?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The list really goes on (and becomes more inane as it does), but I fear that I won&#39;t be getting much sleep tonight.</p>
