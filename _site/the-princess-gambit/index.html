<p>I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cinderella-Ate-Daughter-Dispatches-Girlie-Girl/dp/B006CDDD8K/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0">Cinderella Ate My Daughter</a> a couple of days ago. It covers the difficulties in raising a level-headed, freethinking daughter in a Disney Princess world. Gender typing is nothing new, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever been easy to grow up, whether for boys, girls and others in between, but reading this really opened my eyes to just how hard girls have it.</p>

<p>For as long as I&#39;ve known, girls have had pressures to be liked, to be smart and good looking, to be good at everything. Those pressures are perfectly normal as far I&#39;m concerned -- as a boy in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s I struggled with the same things.</p>

<p>What troubles me about raising a daughter now is that, as media and marketers would have it, it&#39;s not enough to be liked, girls have to be peerless and idolized. They can&#39;t just be pretty, girls have to be the singularly gorgeous. Being good doesn&#39;t cut it, girls have to be great without ever having tried. As for being smart, that&#39;s something girls have to be in secret and without ambition.</p>

<p>My wife and I are concerned about building on good habits, but how do we educate our daughter on the importance of a good diet and exercise without validating what TV and toy stores and the playground are saying; that appearances are important above all else? How do I balance telling my daughter that she&#39;s beautiful against telling her that too often or for the wrong reasons?</p>

<p>Before Amelia was born, my wife and I agreed that we would praise her for working hard, not just for her successes, and to have open and honest conversations about the challenges she&#39;d face. The most frustrating thing I learned from this book is that we&#39;ll be a couple years behind the marketers if we wait until she&#39;s old enough to understand what we have to say.</p>

<p>Disney and Mattel work to get their hooks in little girls between the ages of 2 and 4. How do we counter that? <em>&quot;Yes it&#39;s fun to dress up and be the center of attention, but looks aren&#39;t what make you special.&quot;</em> At what age could she possibly understand that in full? From the grocery store to Sesame Street, there&#39;s a barrage of information that&#39;s trying to shape what little girls think it means to be feminine. How do we avoid or combat this bombardment?</p>

<p>&quot;Barrage&quot;, &quot;combat&quot; and &quot;bombardment&quot;. These words make this sound like a war, and I&#39;m sure some parents see it that way. However, I&#39;m media-savvy enough to know that you can&#39;t stop the signal -- the message is going to get through one way or another -- and I&#39;m empathetic enough to know that we&#39;re not going to win over our child by rejecting everything she shows an interest in.</p>

<p>I think that in the end, all my wife and I can do is guide and encourage our daughter with love -- with patience and devotion -- but Samantha and I need to keep in mind that marketers are trying really hard to manipulate us, too. They&#39;re working to convince us to &quot;preserve&quot; Amelia&#39;s innocence with princess fantasies (and then its tween equivalent as she ages).</p>

<p>I learned a whole lot from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cinderella-Ate-Daughter-Dispatches-Girlie-Girl/dp/B006CDDD8K/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0">Cinderella Ate My Daughter</a> -- I went into it thinking that there wouldn&#39;t be an easy answer and, at the other end of the book, I was a little disappointed to learn that I was right.</p>

<p>Sorry, Amelia, shit&#39;s going to be hard but Mommy and Daddy are right there with you.</p>
