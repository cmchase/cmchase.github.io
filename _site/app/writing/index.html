	        <p>Not 18 hours after posting about <a href="/the-appointment-ledger-smells-funny/">a weird code smell</a>, we found a better solution to using NotificationCenter: exclusiveTouch. Actually, by &quot;we&quot; I mean &quot;John&quot;, the principal software developer I&#39;m working with for our lane application.</p>

	        <p>I recently posted about how <a href="/ios-brain-leak/">my brain leaks out all the Objective-C I know</a> if I go too long without using it, which is barely an exaggeration,  so I made some time in my day this past Friday to clear out a last-minute bug. In that same post, I mentioned how I feel in love with NSNotificationCenter, which I used to try to handle a bug where the UI gets all wonky if the the user taps the VIN Search button while the user had focus on the SearchBar. (I&#39;m simply disabling the VIN Search button until the SearchBar resigns first responder.)</p>

	        <p>We&#39;ve been designing up new dashboards in the app for Subaru and some of the frustrations of client work have been flooding back. I feel like I put up a good fight when it comes to reigning... <em>ambitious</em>... ideas back down to earth, but some times they sneak something in during a review that I just can&#39;t deal well with.</p>

	        <p>I&#39;ve found myself working in iOS again for the past few days for the first time in over a month. Every time I go back to it after a long hiatus I discover just how much Objective-C I&#39;ve forgotten since the last time. </p>

	        <p>My wife sent me a message today that read, &quot;Mia just pooped on the potty.&quot; Being that I&#39;m 1) stupid, and 2) a proud parent, I told my friends at the office to the expected amount of ambivalence. Samantha and I have joked about how odd it is that we casually talk about another human being&#39;s bodily functions, but now we&#39;re practically high-fiving each other because our daughter took a shit in a designated container. Parenthood turns otherwise reasonable people in real weirdos.</p>

	        <p>I went to the first-ever Front-End Design Conference Workshop to get some insight on how <a href="https://twitter.com/nickawalsh">@nickawalsh</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/drewbarontini">@drewbarontini</a> do things over at <a href="http://envylabs.com/">Envy Labs</a>. They were great! They kept things going at a good pace and were super-patient with my constant badgering. They laid out a lot of their processes and the thinking behind their methodologies; I don&#39;t agree with a couple of their approaches -- I&#39;m sure our opinions are colored by the stacks we work in (.NET vs. Rails) and team composition -- but seeing how they do things was invaluable.</p>

	        <p>I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cinderella-Ate-Daughter-Dispatches-Girlie-Girl/dp/B006CDDD8K/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0">Cinderella Ate My Daughter</a> a couple of days ago. It covers the difficulties in raising a level-headed, freethinking daughter in a Disney Princess world. Gender typing is nothing new, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever been easy to grow up, whether for boys, girls and others in between, but reading this really opened my eyes to just how hard girls have it.</p>

	        <p>One day we were strolling through Target and I just about lost my mind. There was this stand, barely even noticeable, filled with little card stock packages. The display had a handful of different types, distinguishable by its own ring of high-saturated color. I grabbed one; it had a fantastic papery texture and exceptional minimalist design with bold, clear lettering, &quot;I have a blister.&quot;</p>

	        <p>In truth - my phone is actually pretty damn awesome. It&#39;s indispensable and I feel naked without it. It&#39;s what makes commuting somewhat bearable; I&#39;ve taken hundreds of photos with its camera and it provides a hedonistic amount of entertainment; it&#39;s my alarm clock, my portable internet, and it&#39;s never more than 10 feet away.</p>

	        <h3 class="post-title">iPad: Yes, I will.</h3>
	        <p>Today I learned that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/03/amazon-and-barnes-noble-plan-to-ride-the-ipad-e-book-train.ars">Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble will be launching apps to support the iPad as an e-book reader</a>. I&#39;ve been secretly wanting an iPad (read: I haven&#39;t been bugging my wife yet), but this news puts me over the edge – now I <em>really</em> want an iPad.</p>

	        <p>Earlier today, <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/3569/">Valve announced</a> that its Steam publishing platform will support the Mac this Spring and I&#39;m crazy-excited. With this, a large number of games based on the Source Engine will also be available on the Mac. (Yay, Portal!) I&#39;m no news guys, but both <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/03/08/valve-confirms-mac-support-for-steam-and-source-engine/">Joystiq</a> and <a href="http://kotaku.com/5488375/left-4-dead-2-team-fortress-2-portal-and-steam-coming-to-mac-in-april">Kotaku</a> have a lot of great info.</p>

	        <p>I&#39;ve been taking an short break from digital productivity and I&#39;ve found it a bit difficult to get back into the &quot;work 12 hours a day&quot; mood. I absolutely love working on the web but I&#39;m sure most would agree that it&#39;s a lot of work to keep up with the industry. There really aren&#39;t enough hours in the day, which (in my weaker moments) leaves me feeling like throwing up my hands and getting off the grid altogether by moving into a woodland cabin.</p>

(We even skipped a honeymoon!) Epcot was a disappointment, being that there&#39;s nothing to do there but eat once you move past Future World, but we really loved our stay at the POP Resort and our visits to Downtown Disney.</p>

A good read on the importance of understanding what your audience wants. I especially liked the example of Apple&#39;s failure with the Newton.</li>

	        <p>When I was in the 10th grade, I had a science teacher by the name of Robert Evans. He was quirky and eccentric, as mandated by the state of Florida for all high school science teachers, but what really stuck with me was his love for the open-book test. (What also stuck was how he would bring in his guitar and play for us songs he wrote; it all sounded like the theme to &#39;Renegade&#39;).</p>

	        <p>I think one of the best ways to capture the interest of customers is to <em>gasp</em> <em>be interesting</em>. I know, it seems like a bunch of crap -- why would anyone want to <em>enjoy</em> reading what a company has to say? What would we do with all the dry, faceless corporate text that&#39;s out there? (Probably the same thing we&#39;re doing now; ignoring it.)</p>

	        <p>Years ago I played World of Warcraft quite a bit --  back when I had considerably more free time. I&#39;ve long stopped playing, but I still look back on it fondly. It was rarely the game itself that held my attention -- it was the people and social aspects that kept me coming back so often (as most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game">MMO</a> players would agree).</p>

	        <p>One of the very first things I learned about working in web design is that you have to find your own gratification. The boss can only pat you on the head so often and you&#39;d better not hold your breath waiting for every client to recognize how awesome you are. I won&#39;t say that I crank out award-winning web sites left and right. (It just wouldn&#39;t be honest and awards are rarely lauded on small-budget sites.) However, I will say that I do my best to take pride in what I do. Surprisingly, this can require some effort.</p>

Don&#39;t go thinking I&#39;m <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Brown">Doc Brown</a> or anything - I just scheduled the post date for 2003. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m the first to come up with this, but it turned out to be pretty easy to do thanks to a huge oversight from the WordPress developers.</p>
