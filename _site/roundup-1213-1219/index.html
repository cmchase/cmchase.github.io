<p><em>Some of the things I enjoyed over the past week:</em></p>

<h3>Online Reading:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>[Think Like Me, Agree With Me](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths</em>blog/2009/12/think-like-me-agree-with-me.html)_ - Seth Godin</strong>
Nice, short read on persuasion and perspective.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em><a href="http://mashable.com/2009/12/18/trident-layers-twitter-ad/">Trident Gum Turns Fan Tweets into Full-Page USA Today Ad</a></em> - Mashable</strong>
Bold, full-page USA Today advertisement for Trident&#39;s new gum. (I have a pack of this in my car. It tastes good for all of 30 seconds and seems too sugary to me.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://aneventapart.com/webdesignsurvey/">A List Apart&#39;s 2009 Web Professional Survey</a></strong>
Technically, it&#39;s not reading but this is a good link to include. If you&#39;re in the business of making web sites, and haven&#39;t taken it yet, then you might want to spend 5-10 minutes to pitch in.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em><a href="http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2009/12/what-does-quality-mean-to-you.html">What Does Quality Mean To You?</a></em> - Obie Fernandez</strong>
A nice inside look into the minds over at Hashrocket. I&#39;d agree with the popular conclusion of &quot;Craftsmanship&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/12/needs-resources-location-schedule-budget-scope.php">Needs + Resources + Location + Schedule + Budget = Scope</a></em> -Â  Whitney Hess</strong>
I think I read this one on UX Matters the previous week, but I won&#39;t go splitting hairs. Whitney is a fantastic writer and I got a lot out of this article.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Offline Reading:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Winning-People-Discover-Principles-Every/dp/0785260897">&quot;Winning With People&quot;</a> - John C. Maxwell</strong>
I finished this book during the week. The first two-thirds were great, but I had to force myself through the rest of the book. At times it was overly-pendantic and quote-driven, but for the most part it was a good read on the value of relationships.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eclipse-Twilight-Saga-Stephenie-Meyer/dp/0316027650/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1261342594&amp;sr=1-2">Eclipse (The Twilight Saga)</a> - Stephanie Meyer</strong>
I also finished the third in the series. (Small accomplishment; these titles are super-fast reads.) I began reading these at my wife&#39;s recommendation (read: command) and this is by far the best written so far. I suffered through far less teen romance this time, which was a pleasant surprise because it&#39;s one of the few aspects I dislike about the stories. (I still prefer the Harry Potter stuff when it comes to Children&#39;s/Young Adult lit.)</p></li>
</ul>
