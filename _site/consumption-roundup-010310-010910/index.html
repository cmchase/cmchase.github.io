<p>Just a small sampling of things I read this week that I thought were noteworthy:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/01/research-is-communication.php">Research Is Communication</a></em> **</strong> - UX Matters - *<em>**Demetrius Madrigal and Bryan McClain</em>*
A good read on the importance of understanding what your audience wants. I especially liked the example of Apple&#39;s failure with the Newton.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em><a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/ambient-user-experience/">Ambient User Experience</a></em> -</strong>** UX Booth -**** Andrew Maier**
Visceral experiences add up, even if you can&#39;t put your finger on it. I often think on why I prefer Publix to Sweet Bay or Target to Walmart.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em><a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/growyourbusiness/businessstrategies/article204534.html">Invest in Your Own Expertise</a></em> **</strong>- Entrepreneur -**** David Port**
I think adding consulting to a business&#39;s offerings is a great way of gently branching out, but I think it&#39;s impossible to move into unless you foster an environment that values and encourages open discussion about your industry. Sitting quietly in your own corner to satisfy an outdated managerial mindset (if you&#39;re talking, reading or writing, you&#39;re not &quot;working&quot;) really dulls tongues and minds alike, even for stakeholders.</p></li>
</ul>
