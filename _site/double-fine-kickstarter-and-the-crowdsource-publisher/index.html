<p>I firmly believe that history was made today.</p>

<p>Double Fine reached out to their fans directly to help them fund a new videogame via Kickstarter and had their goal of $400,000 smashed within 8 hours. By the end of the first day of putting the call out, they earned over a million.</p>

<p>This is the day of $30 million game budgets, so $1 million isn&#39;t necessarily a lot on its own, let alone $400k, but Tim Schafer and his studio aren&#39;t bound by a traditional publisher.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t answering to some other company&#39;s business needs and they don&#39;t have to develop a game that&#39;s everything to everyone. They&#39;re in a unique position of working directly with and for their audience and I&#39;ll bet they&#39;re going to change the entire entertainment industry as a result.</p>

<p>Imagine music, movies, books and TV. How would they be without the limitations of dated business models, studio conglomerates, distribution conflicts or puritanical advertisers?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure Double Fine will produce a great game, but I&#39;m more interested in how the way they got funded will affect so many industries.</p>
