<p>Some of the noteworthy things I&#39;ve read, watched and otherwise took in over the past week.</p>

<p><em>Online:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em><a href="http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/77-styling-an-individual-article/">Styling An Individual Article</a></em> (screencast) - Chris Coyier</strong><a href="http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/77-styling-an-individual-article/">
</a>Great insight via screencast on how you can customize each post in WP. Even though I may never be in the position to make elaborate use of the Art Direction plugin, I learned just how much I envy Coyier. I really don&#39;t know where he finds the time and energy to do all the work he does, but I&#39;m pretty sure my wife would kick me out of the house if I even tried to keep up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em><a href="http://www.adobe.com/designcenter/dialogbox/stylevsdesign/index.html">Style vs. Design</a></em> - Jeffrey Zeldman</strong><a href="http://www.adobe.com/designcenter/dialogbox/stylevsdesign/index.html">
</a>Wow, what a fantastic article! Zeldman is rightfully held up as a leader in the industry. I so often deal with those that confuse style and design and this piece helped me articulate some of the things I knew were off but couldn&#39;t put to words.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/12/testing-your-own-designs-redux.php">Testing Your Own Designs Redux</a> - Paul J. Sherman</strong>
This was in response to another article by the same author discussing the issue of designers testing the usability of their own work. It&#39;s a solid article, but you&#39;d better break out the ol&#39; college-level reading glasses -- a Smashing article this is not. One of the points shared was about approaching self-evaluation with a Zen mentality, which I highly agree with. The mentality behind the small agency I&#39;m with kind of forces me into this self-testing (or else none would be done at all), so I&#39;m always a bit surprised when I hear that it&#39;s not normal for every designer to try to be holistic with their work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em><a href="http://www.drawar.com/articles/you-are-not-a-designer-and-i-am-not-a-musician/55/">You Are Not A Designer And I Am Not A Musician</a></em></strong>
I looked high, low, and places in between but I couldn&#39;t find the name of the author. Regardless, I just can&#39;t get on board with this post. I think a number of really good points were made, but I feel that it&#39;s condescending and I don&#39;t like its holier-than-thou tone. Maybe if I were more familiar with the author I&#39;d like the post more, but it did link to something I liked quite a bit more from Feb. 2008,</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>[Fuck Style](http://www.ideasonideas.com/2008/02/fuck</em>style/)_ - Eric Karjaluoto</strong>
Don&#39;t be fooled by the title. This is an incredibly thoughtful and insightful writeup on the importance of pragmatic, problem-oriented design over egocentric style-driven work. It was especially interesting to run into this a day after reading Zeldman&#39;s Style vs. Design.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://robbsutton.com/blog-article-schedule-truth/"><em>The Truth on Posting Frequency - Blog Article Schedule</em></a> -  Rob Sutton</strong>
MAXIMIZE YOUR BLOGGING POTENTIAL! Call me cynical, but I have a hard time buying into the whole blogging as a profession thing. I find Rob Sutton interesting because he seems genuine to me, but I think the whole concept of blogger entrepreneurialism is going to have to deflate eventually. I don&#39;t think a bottom will fall out like the Tech Bubble, but eventually there&#39;s going to be an acute over-saturation and advertising just won&#39;t be able to pay like it has been. To get of my rant, the article was decent; Quality &gt; Frequency.</p></li>

I got a copy as a Christmas gift and got to spend a few hours digging into it the following day. It&#39;s great so far -- <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/tag/dragon-age-origins">Joystiq</a> has a lot of info on this well-received game -- I just hope productivity doesn&#39;t take a nose dive because of it.</p></li>

*</em>I just started in on this and it&#39;s good so far. It&#39;s great to read about how different parts of our brain react to or process the objects we interact with. I think it&#39;s going to take me a while to make it all the way through this book -- not for a lack of interest but for a lack of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, it wouldn&#39;t be Christmas without big meals, lots of sweets and holiday TV marathons but I&#39;m no more interested in talking about my weight gains than you are with reading about it.</p>
