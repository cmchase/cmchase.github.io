	    <header><h1>What I Do</h1></header>
	    <p>I work as the Lead Web Developer and UI/Front-End Designer for Loop, LLC. We make software that helps auto dealerships manage and communicate with their customers. I primarily work in ASP.NET Web Forms, C#, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS, but I've done a lot in PHP and had a brief fling with Ruby on Rails during <a href="http://r12.railsrumble.com/entries/340-all-these-images" target="_blank">Rails Rumble 2012</a>.</p>

	    <p>I wear a lot of hats, but most of my work lives behind a login. Here are a few examples of what I've done that I can easily share.</p>

	    <header><h1>Wireframing</h1></header>
	    <p>You mentioned that wireframes weren't likely to be a deliverable we'd have to worry about, but I wanted to give a glimpse into one of my responsibilities with Loop. I developed these wireframes and user workflow for a new Business Development Center we're building into our application. (Think in-house call center for dealership phone campaigns.)</p>

	    <header><h1>Simple Brochure Sites</h1></header>
	    <p>Before joining Loop, I worked as a web designer in a high-output studio for clients with small budgets. During my 7 years there, I created about 300 small web sites and maintained hundreds more, so I've seen my share of brochure web sites. The interfaces tend to be incredibly simple and most likely irrelevant to what you need, but I figured I'd include a couple of recent brochure sites I worked on to let you see what my mark-up and CSS are like.</p>

	    <h2>AutoLoop (Brochure Site)</h2>
	    <p>The live site can be seen at <a href="http://autoloop.us">autoloop.us</a>, but the original mock-ups I did are below for reference on how the design evolved with stakeholder feedback. (I had no fewer than 4 execs giving me change requests, and design-by-committee can be a real challenge.) With the exception of the slider, I developed this site using responsive design techniques.</p>

	    </ul>

	    <h2>Air Culinaire</h2>
	    <p>This is a site I developed as a freelancer a few months ago. I was tasked with turning a web studio's design into a custom WordPress template. (I had to do a bit of custom PHP to make this work as more of a CMS than a simple blog, but it was a really straight-forward project otherwise.) You can view the site at <a href="http://www.airculinaireworldwide.com/">airculinaireworldwide.com</a>, and the original PSD->HTML code below so you don't have to sift through WP and PHP generated mark-up.</p>

	    <header><h1>More Complex UIs</h1></header>

	    <p>The following screens are of live pages I did from various applications I work with at Loop. These pages tend to be a lot more complex than a simple brochure site and come with a lot more constraints. (Constraints include various usability concerns between both trained and inexperienced users, interactive and visual consistency with the rest of our very large application, as well as requirements passed down from stakeholders.)</p>

	    <p>All were developed in ASP.NET Web Forms with the exception of "Sesame Street", which is system monitoring site we made in MVC3 with some responsive design techniques so our team could easily check system status on any device.</p>

	    <header><h1>Data Visualization</h1></header>

	    <p>It wasn't discussed, but one of the problems I have to tackle at Loop is how to encode data visually to make it easier for the user to consume. Sometimes it simply calls for a well formatted data table, other times it's a more complex dashboard that provides both charts for analysis and operational UI elements.</p>

	    <header><h1>iOS Development</h1></header>

	    <p>It's probably not directly relevant to your needs, but we just finished developing our first iOS application. (By 'we', I mean the CTO and myself.) Work started in mid-December and I had to ramp up very quickly from zero iOS development experience in order to meet our February deadline. Objective-C was a big shock at first, but I got a lot out of developing a native app.</p>

	    <p>There's a lot of subtle interaction you can't get from screenshots, but we haven't finished the submission process because we're still waiting on some marketing and branding decisions from stakeholders. (I have several logo and splash screen variations that I cooked up, but in the end went with something very simple in an attempt to build exec consensus.)</p>
