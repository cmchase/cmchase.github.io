	    <header><h1>What I Do</h1></header>
	    <p>I work as the Lead Web Developer and UI/Front-End Designer for Loop, LLC. We make software that helps auto dealerships manage and communicate with their customers. I primarily work in ASP.NET Web Forms, C#, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS, but I've done a lot in PHP and had a brief fling with Ruby on Rails during <a href="http://r12.railsrumble.com/entries/340-all-these-images" target="_blank">Rails Rumble 2012</a>.</p>

	    <p>I wear a lot of hats, but most of my work lives behind a login. Here are a few examples of what I've done that I can easily share.</p>

	    <p>This kind of work doesn't get the love it deserves.</p>

	    <p>You'll never see a Top 10 list for awesome wireframes, but it's a crucial tool for exploring complex designs and interactions.</p>

	    <p>Low-fidelity mock-ups are great for spotting problems early on, making it fast and easy to feel out solutions, and the product managers I work with love the sanity checks wireframes provide for requirement docs.</p>

	    <header><h1>Brochure Sites</h1></header>
	    <p>Before joining Loop, I worked as a web designer in a high-output studio for clients with small budgets. During my 7 years there, I created hundreds of small web sites and maintained over a thousand more. Even though I don't work on them very often these days, I have seen my fair share of brochure web sites.</p>

	    <p>While the interfaces tend to be relatively simple and the problems they solve limited in scope, brochure sites can still be fun to work on, especially if you throw the challenges of responsive design in the mix.</p>

	<section class="panel-content">
	    <h2>SmartLane</h2>
	    <p>The support site I cooked up for our recently launched iOS application can be found at <a href="http://autoloop.us/SmartLane">autoloop.us/SmartLane</a>. The Marketing Department wasn't able to help, so I was responsible for everything on this site, from design and development to copy-writing.</p>

	    <p>I think this one was a great experience &mdash; it's a single page scrolling, responsive site. Getting the active states of the navigation to correctly match the scroll position was an interesting challenge.</p>

	    <h2>AutoLoop</h2>
	    <p>The live site can be seen at <a href="http://autoloop.us">autoloop.us</a>, but the original mock-ups I did are below for reference on how the design evolved with stakeholder feedback. (I had no fewer than 4 execs giving me change requests, and design-by-committee can be a real challenge.) With the exception of the slider, I developed this site using responsive design techniques.</p>

	    <h2>Air Culinaire</h2>
	    <p>This is a site I developed as a freelancer when I was asked turn a web studio's design into a custom WordPress template. It included the standard PSD to HTML conversion, and I had to do a bit of custom PHP to make this work as more of a CMS than a simple blog, but it was a really straight-forward project otherwise. The screenshots below are of the code rendered in browser, and the site can be seen at <a href="http://www.airculinaireworldwide.com/">airculinaireworldwide.com</a>.</p>

	    <header><h1>Interface Design</h1></header>

	    <p>Here are some things I did for various applications I work with at Loop. These pages tend to be a lot more complex than a simple brochure site, and they come with a lot more constraints.</p>

	    <p>(Constraints include various usability concerns between both trained and inexperienced users, interactive and visual consistency with the rest of our very large application, as well as requirements passed down from stakeholders.)</p>

	    <h2>Nav Redesign</h2>
		<p>One of the absolute biggest problems we struggle with for AutoLoop is site navigation. For various reasons, both good and bad, we've been locked into some decisions made many years ago.</p>

		<p>These are some concepts I shared with our CPO. The interaction isn't exactly spelled out, but hovering or tapping on the logo provides a large dropdown containing all high-level navigation. This solves a number of issues for us: it frees up screen real estate and user cognitive load; it simplifies the management of dynamic content based on user permission; and it makes it far easier to add more top-tier features and applications to the site.</p>

		<p>We won't be getting around to the app redesign for a little bit yet, but I think the idea is worth revisiting.</p>

	    <header><h1>Data Visualization</h1></header>
	    <p>It wasn't discussed, but one of the problems I have to tackle at Loop is how to encode data visually to make it easier for the user to consume. Sometimes it simply calls for a well formatted data table, other times it's a more complex dashboard that provides both charts for analysis and operational UI elements.</p>

	    <header><h1>iOS Development</h1></header>
	    <p>It's probably not directly relevant to your needs, but we just finished developing our first iOS application. (By 'we', I mean the CTO and myself.) Work started in mid-December and I had to ramp up very quickly from zero iOS development experience in order to meet our February deadline. Objective-C was a big shock at first, but I got a lot out of developing a native app.</p>

	    <p>There's a lot of subtle interaction you can't get from screenshots, but we haven't finished the submission process because we're still waiting on some marketing and branding decisions from stakeholders. (I have several logo and splash screen variations that I cooked up, but in the end went with something very simple in an attempt to build exec consensus.)</p>
