	    <header><h1>What I Do</h1></header>
	    <p>I work as the Lead Web Developer and UI/Front-End Designer for Loop, LLC. We make software that helps auto dealerships manage and communicate with their customers. I primarily work in ASP.NET Web Forms, C#, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS, but I've done a lot in PHP and had a brief fling with Ruby on Rails during <a href="/rails-rumble-2012/">Rails Rumble 2012</a> and <a href="/rails-rumble-2013">Rails Rumble 2013</a>.</p>

	    <p>I wear a lot of hats, but most of my work lives behind a login. Here are a few examples of what I've done that I can easily share.</p>

	    <p>This kind of work doesn't get the love it deserves. You'll never see a Top 10 list for awesome wireframes, but it's a crucial tool for exploring complex designs and interactions.</p>

	    <p>Sometimes they'll spring from the jumbled and raw text of a requirements document, other times from that incidental break room conversation. Low-fidelity mock-ups are great for spotting problems early on, making it fast and easy to feel out solutions.</p>

	    <p>I really wish I could tell some good stories about the following items, you deserve it, but I just can't create enough context to do the problems justice.</p>

	    <header><h1>Brochure Sites</h1></header>
	    <p>Before joining Loop, I worked as a web designer in a high-output studio for clients with small budgets. During my 7 years there, I created hundreds of small web sites and maintained many hundreds more. Even though I don't work on them very often these days, I have seen my fair share of brochure web sites.</p>

	    <p>While the interfaces tend to be relatively simple and the problems they solve limited in scope, brochure sites can still be fun to work on, especially if you throw the challenges of responsive design in the mix.</p>

	    <h2>SmartLane</h2>
	    <p>The support site I cooked up for our recently launched iOS application can be found at <a href="http://autoloop.us/SmartLane">autoloop.us/SmartLane</a>. The Marketing Department wasn't able to help, so I was responsible for everything on this site, from design and development to copy-writing.</p>

	    <p>I think this one was a great experience &mdash; it's a single page scrolling, responsive site. Getting the active states of the navigation to correctly match the scroll position was an interesting challenge.</p>

	    <h2>AutoLoop</h2>
	    <p>The live site can be seen at <a href="http://autoloop.us">autoloop.us</a>, but the original mock-ups I did are below for reference on how the design evolved with stakeholder feedback. (I had no fewer than 4 execs giving me change requests, and design-by-committee can be a real challenge.) With the exception of the slider, I developed this site using responsive design techniques.</p>

	    <h2>Air Culinaire</h2>
	    <p>This is a site I developed as a freelancer when I was asked turn a web studio's design into a custom WordPress template. It included the standard PSD to HTML conversion, and I had to do a bit of custom PHP to make this work as more of a CMS than a simple blog, but it was a really straight-forward project otherwise. The screenshots below are of the code rendered in browser, and the site can be seen at <a href="http://www.airculinaireworldwide.com/">airculinaireworldwide.com</a>.</p>

	    <p>Here are some things I did for various applications I work with at Loop. These pages tend to be a lot more complex than a simple brochure site, and they come with a lot more constraints.</p>

	    <p>(Constraints include various usability concerns between both trained and inexperienced users, interactive and visual consistency with the rest of our very large application, as well as requirements passed down from stakeholders.)</p>

	    <h2>Nav Redesign</h2>
		<p>One of the absolute biggest problems we struggle with for AutoLoop is site navigation. For various reasons, both good and bad, we've been locked into some decisions made many years ago.</p>

		<p>These are some concepts I shared with our CPO. The interaction isn't exactly spelled out, but hovering or tapping on the logo provides a large dropdown containing all high-level navigation. This solves a number of issues for us: it frees up screen real estate and user cognitive load; it simplifies the management of dynamic content based on user permission; and it makes it far easier to add more top-tier features and applications to the site.</p>

		<p>We won't be getting around to the app redesign for a little bit yet, but I think the idea is worth revisiting.</p>

	    <header><h1>Data Visualization</h1></header>
	    <p>Dashboards, reports and graphs can be really fun to work with, but wrapping your head around data to do them well can be a real challenge.</p>

	    <p>I work closely with product managers to encode the data they want reported into compelling and useful screens.</p>

	    <p>Fun fact, I design my graphs in Google's Chart Playground just to be sure what we need can readily be done with their API. It adds a bit of time to the process, but I think it's better safe than sorry.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="panel-content">

	    <h2>Charts &amp; Graphs</h2>
	    <p>Encoding data into charts can be a challenge. Sometimes it involves using tools you don't like (ugh, pie charts!) Other times it requires complex interactions to get all the request data on screen. Most times, however, it involves a bit of push back on the stakeholders to see if all the information requested is actually necessary or to see if like-charts can be merged to do things like sharing an X-axis.</p>

	    <h2>Data Tables</h2>

	    <p>Without a doubt, tables are totally abused at the hands of engineers. I get it &mdash; it's fast, easy, and doesn't require much thought because the content is already coming from a table in the database, but they don't necessarily do anything for the user. Below are two examples of data tables I've done.</p>

	    <p>This first one is a redesign of a page I did that originally had 6 separate tables spat up on it. After a little data culling and with a content filter, we were able to bring the content down to a single table with very clear relationships in the data reported.</p>

	    <div class="works-images">
        	<a class="works-image-link" href="/assets/img/works/data/email-collection-all-lg.jpg">
        		<img src="/assets/img/works/data/email-collection-all-sm.jpg" />
    		</a>        	
   	    	<img src="" class="works-full-image">
	    </div>

	    <p>This second example is a page that would be far better off in an Excel spreadsheet. Since that wasn't an option, I had to figure out a way to display a crazy amount of information in a very limited amount of space. I think breaking these sections out into their own page would help a lot, especially with the complex row and column collapsing that's going on, but that wasn't an option either.</p>

	    <header><h1>iOS Development</h1></header>

	    <p>We recently launched our first iOS application and I had to ramp up very quickly from zero iOS development experience in order to meet a hard deadline.</p>

	    <p>I cooked up all of the visual assets and did quite a bit of the necessary code for the UI. Unfortunately, that all came after initial app prototyping, so the layout isn't as refined as I think it could have been if we had given ourselves more time.</p>

	    <p>Objective-C was a big shock at first, I can't believe how much I take for granted when it comes to web development, but I got a lot out of developing a native app.</p>

	    <p>There's a lot of subtle interaction you can't get from screenshots and, while the app can be downloaded from the App Store, it's hidden behind a login.</p>
