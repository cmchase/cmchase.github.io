<p>Did you ever play that game, &quot;<em>What would your porn name be?</em>&quot; It&#39;s easy: just take the name of your childhood pet (we had a big dog named Toby) and append the street you grew up on (I grew up on Sherwood Circle). <em>Toby Sherwood</em>? Perfect!</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, a young woman must have had a cat named &quot;Cory&quot;, grew up on &quot;Chase Drive&quot; or something, and happened to go pro.</p>

<h2>Pornography is a Big Deal</h2>

<p>In case you didn&#39;t know, porn is why VHS won over Beta and and a big contributor to the rapid growth of the internet (<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/04/23/porn.technology/index.html?hpt=Sbin">CNN Article</a>).</p>

<p>I won&#39;t knock porn -- if prostitution is the oldest profession, then voyeurism is the oldest hobby. Unlike prostitution, the adult entertainment industry doesn&#39;t bring drugs or crime into neighborhoods. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s got faults, but I&#39;ve never seen a porn star crawling home at 6am while I drive into work.</p>

<p>I&#39;m largely indifferent about porn -- I neither consume nor take offense, even when a porn star goes by my given name.</p>

<h2>Namespace Collision</h2>

<p>A few months ago, &quot;Cory Chase&quot; contacted me and asked to buy this domain. She was building a new site and, like any business person, wanted a good address for it. I respectfully declined, and she was very cordial despite her disappointment. She even joked that it must be weird that a porn actress shares my name.</p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s a little weird, but what&#39;s the big deal? If a client or employer gets put off by the coincidence then we&#39;re probably not a good fit. It&#39;s not like creepy guys are confusing &quot;Cory Chase&quot; the web developer and &quot;Cory Chase&quot; the actress.</p>

<h2>Then a Creepy Guy Confused Us</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve gotten some weird messages in my gmail account. I guess there are a lot of cmchase&#39;s out there -- I&#39;ve gotten birthday wishes from grandmothers, church announcements, university memos and even an account or two registered with my email address. I do my best to let senders (or system admins) know about the mistake and we all move on with our lives. I think it&#39;s kind of interesting -- you know, voyeuristic -- to get a peak into a stranger&#39;s life like that.</p>

<p>But not so with the message from last Thursday where I got a little too much information about the kind of stuff &quot;Cory Chase&quot; has to deal with. Here&#39;s the message but, out of respect for (and fear of retribution from) the creepy guy I&#39;ll withhold his name:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i have seen your videos and was wondering if you could smother my face with your ass and squirt all over me with your sexy p**<em>y. i would also love it if you could tease the sh</em>t out of me by grinding on my d*ck ob me and hand job and blow job but not letting me cum. light ballsqueezes would also be nice</p>

<p>I just happened to be checking my email in a crowded elevator when I saw this. I&#39;m not really one to care what strangers think of me, but I discreetly turned off my phone display.</p>

<p>3 reasons I knew this wasn&#39;t meant for me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I didn&#39;t recognize the sender. I wouldn&#39;t put it past a friend to goof on me like this, especially with a CC to my wife.</p></li>
<li><p>There aren&#39;t any videos of me floating around, unless you count the ones of me playing with my daughter, in which case this guy&#39;s an even bigger creeper.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t have a vagina, putting that second request out of the question.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I showed the message to my wife and we joked about sending a reply, but thinking about the type of person that would send this message gave me pause. What did he expect in response? What&#39;s with the polite greeting? The &quot;i would also love it&quot; (sic) part seems like a sincere invitation -- is that his intention? Replying to him, whether in earnest or jest, probably would have gotten weird really fast.</p>

<p>However, my absolute favorite part is that last sentence. It&#39;s so casual and shameless -- it almost seems innocent in tone. It&#39;s like when you&#39;re running to the store and someone says, &quot;Oh, and pick up some milk.&quot;</p>

<p>I hope &quot;Cory Chase&quot; has a long and successful career in porn. Sharing names might make for an interesting conversation for me once in a while, but that&#39;s nothing compared to the kind of attention I&#39;m sure she gets.</p>
