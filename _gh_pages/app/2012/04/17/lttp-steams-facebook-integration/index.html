<p>Just today I was just wondering why Steam doesn&#39;t work with my Facebook friends list. It makes sense -- I&#39;ve got to know tons of people that I&#39;ve never sought out in Steam...</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that I just haven&#39;t been using Steam nearly enough because it&#39;s been there since last June.</p>
