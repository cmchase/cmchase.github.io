<p>It was my extreme pleasure to take part in this year&#39;s <a href="http://railsrumble.com/entries/340-all-these-images">Rails Rumble</a>. Despite my lack of Rails experience, my friends <a href="http://ambethia.com/">Jason</a>, <a href="http://tylerjohnst.github.com/">Tyler</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/dedguy">James</a> invited me to help them develop <a href="http://alltheseimages.com/">All These Images!</a>, an application that helps you collect images and position them in a moodboard.</p>

<p>It was a fantastic experience, and I learned so much over the 48 hours we were allowed in the competition, but it was super-stressful because I only had a couple weeks to learn a lot of new things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Basic Ruby on Rails (duh)</p></li>
<li><p>CoffeeScript</p></li>
<li><p>Backbone</p></li>
<li><p>Sass</p></li>
<li><p>Haml</p></li>
<li><p>Bootstrap</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I spent so many nights hunkered down in front of <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/">CodeSchool</a> for crash courses on those first four but could have easily used another month or two just to feel comfortable. As it was, I didn&#39;t get to even glance at the documentation for Haml until the night before the Rumble and wasn&#39;t able to checkout Bootstrap until I had to actually use it. (I&#39;ve used 960grid and Skeleton, so CSS frameworks aren&#39;t completely foreign to me.)</p>

<p>Fortunately, Tyler is a total Backbone wizard so I didn&#39;t have to touch a line of it, but I had to muddle my way through everything else. Experience in C#/ASP.NET meant dick in Rails, and my knowledge of JavaScript only mapped to CoffeScript for the simplest of functions. I had to rely on a JS-&gt;CoffeeScript translator for all my conditional syntax as well as passing parameters into functions.</p>

<p>And, God help me, my Sublime Text kept defaulting back to tabbed indentation.</p>

<p>I was fine with Haml until I actually needed to write out an element. <em><a href class="style">Link</a></em> is <em>%a.style{:href =&gt; &quot;&quot;} Link</em>?</p>

<p>Yeah, I had to find another translator. Of all the new things I had to work with, I liked Haml the least. I don&#39;t really understand the need for it -- it&#39;s far more error prone and its only slightly less verbose than the HTML it abstracts. It&#39;s great for basic layout elements and I&#39;m sure I could get used to it, but it seems like a bad way to manage content.</p>

<p>Sass was a different story --  I had to refer to documentation to do the CSS animation mixins for the splash page and the modal dialogues, and I wanted to pop my semi-colon out of the keyboard so I&#39;d stop using it on accident, but Sass was mostly a piece of cake. I liked Sass a lot -- I don&#39;t get to use a preprocessor at my day job and I was totally spoiled by it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how well we&#39;ll place in the competition, and I don&#39;t especially care -- I&#39;m just really grateful that I got to participate. Jason and Tyler are mind-blowingly good developers and extremely patient instructors -- they always answered my questions with enthusiasm and never let on that I was slow to complete tasks. Jason never gave me shit about all my link_to and asset pipeline questions, and Tyler didn&#39;t make me feel like an asshole when he helped me fix an app-slowing scope issue in one of my CoffeeScript files.</p>

<p>To add to my humility and awe, James cranked out some of the most incredible illustrations and copy for the application. I really think <a href="http://alltheseimages.com/">All These Images!</a> has a ton of charm and character, and all of it either came directly from James or was inspired by his art direction.</p>

<p>It was completely exhausting, I totally missed my wife and daughter, and I could barely wait for everyone to leave my house, but I had a fantastic weekend and learned a lot in the process -- I&#39;m looking forward to Rails Rumble 2013.</p>
