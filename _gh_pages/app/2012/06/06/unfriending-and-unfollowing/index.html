<p>I recently got a message on Facebook from a family member. She wasn&#39;t sure why  we weren&#39;t friends already, but I really needed to accept her friend request right away.</p>

<p>I declined it. The thing is, we&#39;ve been friends twice before, and I&#39;ve unfriended her twice before.</p>

<p>I&#39;m extremely selective about the people I befriend on Facebook and follow on Twitter. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m special -- I&#39;m not popular and I&#39;m no web socialite, I&#39;m just trying to keep things manageable.</p>

<p>Consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&#x27;s_number">Dunbar&#39;s number</a>. Also consider that I&#39;m trying to manage my very, very valuable attention. (Attention: it&#39;s the new &#39;time&#39;, as in &#39;Time is Money&#39;.)</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you and I are friends on some social network and you happen to play games or run exercise apps that post status updates on your behalf. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re having a great time, but those things totally clutter up my feeds with intrusive garbage despite my account settings, so our friendship just can&#39;t last.</p>

<p>Sorry -- it&#39;s not you, it&#39;s me. (That last part is completely untrue -- it&#39;s all you -- but sometimes it feels nice to act apologetic.) I&#39;ve unfriended/unfollowed more than my fair share because of pseudo-social advertisement, and I&#39;m really not ashamed of it.</p>
