<p>My wife sent me a message today that read, &quot;Mia just pooped on the potty.&quot; Being that I&#39;m 1) stupid, and 2) a proud parent, I told my friends at the office to the expected amount of ambivalence. Samantha and I have joked about how odd it is that we casually talk about another human being&#39;s bodily functions, but now we&#39;re practically high-fiving each other because our daughter took a shit in a designated container. Parenthood turns otherwise reasonable people in real weirdos.</p>

<p>Speaking of pooping in a little plastic toilet, Don Mattrick has left Microsoft for Zynga just a few weeks after leading the Xbox team into a minefield at E3. Polygon has <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/7/2/4487930/9-things-to-know-about-don-mattricks-move-from-xbox-one-to-zynga">a fantastic write-up</a> on the topic, but the extremely short version is that Microsoft really, really botched their messaging at a recent gaming expo and then Mattrick went on to dig the hole deeper with some follow-up comments. </p>

<p>The fact that someone is leaving Microsoft isn&#39;t that surprising, but to move to Zynga is like escaping a fire by boarding a sinking ship -- I&#39;m not sure what to think about Zynga&#39;s stock <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/07/02/tech-stocks-zynga/2482079/">going up like 11%</a> in response. (If you&#39;ve never heard any insight on Zynga, here&#39;s <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fpbv1/i_was_one_of_the_520_people_laid_off_by_zynga/">a great Reddit AMA</a> from one of the people they recently laid off.)</p>

<p>For record, I&#39;m patiently waiting to see if Microsoft can sort things out for the Xbox One -- with indie developer support being my biggest concern -- but I&#39;m no fan of Zynga and they can continue to sink for all I care.</p>
