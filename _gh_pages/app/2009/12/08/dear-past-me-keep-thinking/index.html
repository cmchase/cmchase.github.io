<p>We all wish we knew then what we know now. What would you say to yourself at the start of your current career? &quot;<a href="http://www.corychase.com/tag/dear-past-me/">Dear Past Me</a>&quot; is a series of posts where I explore just that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a sad thing, but there will be times when you&#39;re less appreciated for being thoughtful and creative than for being able to perform a task others can&#39;t. <a href="http://www.corychase.com/dear-past-me-dont-hate/">Accept it for what it is and let it go</a>. It&#39;s a part of working for someone else and it helps keep the lights on...</p>

<h2>Just Don&#39;t Turn Off Your Brain</h2>

<p>Sure, it&#39;s easier to get through mundane tasks when you&#39;re on autopilot: washing dishes, digging ditches and typing out 3 pages of faxed text because a client refuses to send an e-mail all come to mind. That&#39;s okay -- listen to some music or a podcast or whatever keeps you sane -- but if you stop thinking for yourself then you&#39;ll eventually run into problems.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Big knife fall into the sink? Stop washing and fish it out.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the hole starting to smell like natural gas? Stop digging and put out that cigarette.</p></li>
<li><p>Giant &#39;F-bomb scrawled across the page? Stop typing and contact that e-mail adverse client.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We can&#39;t always be presented with interesting problems and we won&#39;t always be learning new things, but firing a few extra synapses will keep you from making stupid mistakes and looking like a jackass.</p>
