<p>I hate to be the bearer of bad news (not really), but the stuff you&#39;re doing sucks. You should be ashamed of yourself. Are you an embarrassment to your family or do you just lie and tell them you dig ditches for a living?</p>

<p>Wait. What are you doing? C&#39;mon, don&#39;t cry... I didn&#39;t mean it! Well, sorta. I&#39;m no fan of the stuff you&#39;re producing back then, but that&#39;s just because I&#39;m a lot better at it than you.</p>

<h2>Toughen up, Buttercup!</h2>

<p>My point isn&#39;t to insult you -- it&#39;s to remind you that you should value criticism, even if destructive (as opposed to <em>constructive</em>). Of course you want feedback to be thoughtful and well articulated, but it doesn&#39;t always come out that way. Sometimes people just have a hard time communicating (or even forming) their thoughts.</p>

<p>Put aside any reactions for a minute and ask yourself what they might be trying to say or where they&#39;re coming from. Still can&#39;t figure out what they&#39;re thinking? ASK THEM QUESTIONS! You&#39;ll be surprised by the kind of input you can get from a person when they see you&#39;re genuinely interested.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re lucky and willing to listen you might learn something in the conversation. You might find another way of looking at a problem, how to avoid similar exchanges in the future or, chances are fair, that the person you&#39;re dealing with is a total jackass. Yeah, that last one is pretty negative but it&#39;s important to learn how to deal with the occasional jackass. Just because you&#39;re not serving tables or working behind a counter doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have to deal with self-entitled jerks.</p>

<p>Remember:Â  everything can be a learning experience and be sure to let your critic know that you value their input. (Generally, most people like to be helpful and everyone wants to be appreciated.)</p>
