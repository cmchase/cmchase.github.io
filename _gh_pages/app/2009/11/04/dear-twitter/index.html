<p>What&#39;s happening to us? Did I do something wrong? You&#39;ve always been interested in others, but I used to feel so welcomed when I showed up.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know when or why it happened, but now it seems like you&#39;ve only got eyes for new people. Was it something I tweeted?</p>

<p>Now it seems like I have to work extra hard to come back -- did you forget about me, the existing user? I see that there&#39;s a little box with a jQuery function attached, which is neat, but I still feel a bit slighted. I know you guys don&#39;t see eye-to-eye, but maybe you could learn a thing or two from Facebook. They manage to bring new people to the party without ignoring the rest of us.</p>

<p>Look, let&#39;s be honest here... I&#39;d much rather get it on with you but Facebook is in this relationship for the long haul. Is there any way we can compromise?</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s really low-res, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m asking for too much and you still look incredible.</p>
