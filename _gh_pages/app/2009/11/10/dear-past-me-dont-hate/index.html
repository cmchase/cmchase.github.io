<p>It&#39;s been a week since to you/myself 7 years in the past and time hasn&#39;t folded in on itself in some weird paradoxical, so I guess it&#39;s safe for me to do it again and I&#39;m sure you have a lot of questions about the future:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Internet Explorer 6 is here to stay so you&#39;d better get used to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Star Trek: Enterprise gets great around season 3.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s chubby in the future. Consider sit-ups.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Okay. Ready for tip-from-the-future #2?</p>

<h2>You may not like what you&#39;re doing or who you&#39;re doing it for, but you still need to have respect.</h2>

<p>A lot of people fancy themselves designers and will turn you into a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pixel+pusher">pixel pusher</a>. To make matters worse, very few people know how to value good design. <em>(You&#39;ll be surprised to know that the &lt; blink &gt; tag is still in high-demand and &quot;rainbow&quot; is a favored text color.)</em> Coding is less of a problem because it borders on mysticism to the laymen, but now and again you&#39;ll run into clients that consider themselves an &quot;expert&quot; because they used FrontPage back in &#39;98.</p>

<p>Yes, you&#39;re going to work on less-than-ideal projects and for less-than-awesome clients. You&#39;re going to feel angry, frustrated, overwhelmed, underwhelmed and just about every negative emotion there is. And that&#39;s okay -- it&#39;s surprisingly normal, but you need to maintain respect for everyone and everything involved.</p>

<h2>It&#39;s not just good customer service.</h2>

<p>Something taught in retail is that the customer is always right. Quite frankly, that&#39;s a load of crap. Red is not blue.</p>

<p>The way I see it: the customer should always <em>feel</em> right. Companies have policies, contracts, statements and whatever to protect themselves. If there&#39;s conflict with a client, there might be some bending involved until things <em>feel</em> right again. Flexibility is great when there&#39;s room for it, and compromise is respectful of all involved. Yes sir, that red has a really nice blue tone to it. <em>(Purple is the new red.)</em></p>

<p>The sad truth is that some people are just jackasses, or have unwaveringly bad ideas, and compromise isn&#39;t an option. No big deal. You&#39;ll eventually get a handle on which problems you can solve and which ones you can&#39;t. Do what you can about the former and let go of the latter. The important thing to remember is that every project and every client is a lesson waiting to be had -- if you disrespect them by being dismissive or lazy then you&#39;re only cheating yourself.</p>

<p>Yeah, it sounds cliche but it&#39;s 90% true.</p>
