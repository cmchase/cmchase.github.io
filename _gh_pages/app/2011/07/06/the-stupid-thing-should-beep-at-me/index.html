<p>A few weeks ago I finished reading <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Mind-Simple-Understanding-Interface/dp/012375030X">Designing with the Mind in Mind</a></em> by Jeff Johnson, which was a great book that I&#39;d highly recommend to anyone interested in the psychology of design. One of my favorite sections was in Chapter 8, &quot;<strong>Limits on Attention, Shape, Thought and Action</strong>&quot;, was about primary goals and cleanup steps.</p>

<p>In short, once we finish the main goal of a given task, we tend to shift our (limited) attention other tasks entirely, forgetting all about the loose ends we left behind. Some examples Johnson used:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Leaving turn signals on after making a turn.</p></li>
<li><p>Forgetting to take original documents out of a scanner or fax.</p></li>
<li><p>Neglecting to close parentheses or quotations when typing. (Forgetting to close a block of code sounds pretty familiar...)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>He goes on with more good examples and what can or has been done to avoid these &quot;end-of-task short-term memory lapses&quot;, but my mind immediate went to an example of my own.</p>

<h2>Cashiers: Guides to the Debit Card Machine</h2>

<p>It&#39;s insane that no matter how many times I&#39;ve used them, I almost always forget a step somewhere when using my debit card to checkout from a store. It normally goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I put my items up on the counter</p></li>
<li><p>Get greeted/ignored by the cashier</p></li>
<li><p>Swipe my debit card and enter my PIN</p></li>
</ul>

<p>From here I typically get distracted by any number of things; chatting with my wife, monitoring prices as they scan, that annoying kid on register 7 -- whatever. Meanwhile a monochromatic, passive-matrix screen is prompting me for more information:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do you want to make a donation?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you want this entire purchase on one card?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you approve X amount?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you want cash back?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>No matter what the tiny green screen says, I&#39;m not going to see it unless I&#39;m looking directly at it, and that&#39;s frustrating for everyone involved. The person behind the counter has wait for me to notice the lull in activity or politely point out that I&#39;m not paying attention, and I have to feel like a moron for forgetting to babysit a machine. What&#39;s more, you can recognize the especially frustrated employees because they don&#39;t even wait for you to mess up, they&#39;ll prompt you through the entire process in a droning &quot;I&#39;ve-said-this-1000-times-today&quot; voice before you even open your wallet -- &quot;<em>It&#39;s going to ask you for X, you need to Y before you Z</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t really blame them -- if I turn my head away from the machine, I&#39;m likely to forget all about it and it&#39;ll be up to the cashier to bring me back to task. Once I got a little huffy and said to the cashier, &quot;The stupid thing should beep at me, or have a blinking red light or something. Doesn&#39;t it drive you crazy?&quot;</p>

<p>She just smiled at me politely, because it DOES drive her crazy but there&#39;s nothing she can do about it.</p>
