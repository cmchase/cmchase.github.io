<p>I recently had to renew the domain name for this site. Like many, I just go through GoDaddy because, well... I don&#39;t know why. I never gave it any thought before, but I doubt I&#39;ll ever do it again. The following day I just mentioned the renewal to my friend Mark at the office -- I didn&#39;t even go into details before his ranting response inspired the title for this post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“GoDaddy is a f*cking labyrinth -- how many minotaurs did _you _have to kill?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were laughs, but really... what&#39;s wrong here? Two experienced users, a software engineer and a web developer, both had such a hard time with GoDaddy that they sat around and whined about it?</p>

<p>GoDaddy is successful and resourceful. They&#39;ve been doing business on the web since &#39;97 and have tons of e-commerce experience. So, how could they possibly botch the domain renewal experience so badly? It&#39;s a pretty business-critical transaction, isn&#39;t it? I took screenshots throughout the process because the experience just screamed &quot;<em>complain about this in public</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>I originally went through the renewal process and was ready to checkout before I realized I didn&#39;t have my wallet with me, so I just left it for later. When I came back, the home page looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2011/05/01start-300x259.png" alt="Obligatory disclaimer that I&#39;ve added the red arrows"></p>

<p>Notice that I&#39;ve an item in the cart (top-right) and a domain expiration notice (left), but why am I still being prompted to log in (top)? If I&#39;m not logged in, how you know this stuff about my account?</p>

<p>Finding my domain would have been easy enough through the Account button, but I just went straight to the cart from the top-right link and was rewarded with the real impetus for this post; the Upsell:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2011/05/03extras-461x1024.png" alt="Several screens stitched together in Photoshop to show the whole gauntlet"></p>

<p>These (nearly 3) screens really changed things for me. After a few seconds of earnestly reading product descriptions, I concluded that GoDaddy was trying to _trick _me into buying more. I went into defensive mode -- they were a hostile and aggressive salesman trying to take advantage of me. Normally I experiment with interfaces, I click things to see what happens, but not this time. I cautiously scrolled to the bottom of the page only to meet a pair of confusing buttons, &quot;No Thanks&quot; and &quot;Add &amp; Continue&quot;.</p>

<p>Wait a minute... I want to continue but I don&#39;t want to add anything -- if I click &quot;Add &amp; Continue&quot; will something else be added to my purchase? If I say &quot;No Thanks&quot; am I backing out of the entire purchase or just the extra junk? At this point, all trust in the process has been shattered -- I wanted to finish and get the heck out of there as soon as I could, which takes us to the payment screen:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2011/05/04checkout-300x259.png" alt="It should go without saying that I added the red arrows and path, but I evidently said it anyway."></p>

<p>What a mess... I&#39;m still being asked to log in even after I&#39;ve completed that step, so I&#39;m feeling a little more shaky about all this. And then there&#39;s the form -- everyone likes eyeball acrobatics, right? <img src="/assets/img/2011/05/answer-no1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It really took effort to finish the form, mostly when I got to Step 4 with the terms and purchase summary. I don&#39;t mean that it was <em>hard</em>, I&#39;m saying it took a lot more thought than it should have. Payment forms aren&#39;t new -- I completely understand that good ones can be a challenge, but go copy someone else&#39;s if you don&#39;t feel up to solving this problem. I really wonder what the percentage of cart abandonment is -- is it possible that users feel like they&#39;ve invested too much to turn back now?</p>

<p>The confirmation screen had some room for improvement too, but I&#39;d prefer to wrap my post up with the customer survey I completed (out of masochistic curiosity). I just want to point out the first and third questions:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2011/05/06survey-718x1024.png" alt="I stitched together all the options for the third question."></p>

<p>So, they recognize that the surveyed could possibly be building/supporting a website, whether for others or for themselves, but they don&#39;t have a single tech-related option under the industry question? I guess &quot;Professional&quot; is close, but that&#39;s a pretty broad umbrella for  web development...</p>

<p>Could they have meant <em>&quot;Which of the following best describes your <strong>website&#39;s</strong> industry</em>&quot;? Either way, how useful could this survey data be if the questions are either misleading and/or its answers are incomplete?</p>

<p>This was a really painful user experience for me, but GoDaddy <em>has</em> to have a team of designers, right? Maybe a UI/UX professional or two? I know I didn&#39;t really go into any depth on the problems, and I certainly haven&#39;t proposed any solutions, but why hasn&#39;t any one of the dozens/hundreds/thousands of people working with GoDaddy questioned their process?</p>
