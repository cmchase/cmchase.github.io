<p>My wife and I had a great time during our recent Disney getaway. It&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve ever really &quot;vacationed&quot; during our 8 years together. (We even skipped a honeymoon!) Epcot was a disappointment, being that there&#39;s nothing to do there but eat once you move past Future World, but we really loved our stay at the POP Resort and our visits to Downtown Disney.</p>

<p>During our trip, I learned a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When going on vacation, try to make more time than just a 3-day weekend.Â  We&#39;re lucky to live within a two-hour drive of Disney, but I would have liked a &quot;down&quot; day at the resort and rushing on a Sunday night to get ready for the work week is never fun.</p></li>
<li><p>I really like the benefits of a &quot;packaged&quot; vacation. We stayed at a really inexpensive Disney resort, and the room kind of reflected that, but buses were always running to and from everywhere we wanted. It&#39;s so awesome to not have to worry about stupid details like driving directions or traffic or paying for parking.</p></li>
<li><p>When going to Disney, BRING LOTS OF MONEY. We weren&#39;t hurting or anything, but you just can&#39;t get a decent meal for less than $15 and a bottle of water will run you $3.</p></li>
<li><p>Skip Epcot and just go hang out at Downtown Disney. All the same sites, better food (<a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/destinations/downtown-disney/dining/raglan-road-irish-pub-and-restaurant/">Raglan Road</a> is fantastic!), you can catch a movie and you&#39;ll save yourself $80 per person.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My wife and I have agreed that we need to make more time for getaways, we&#39;re hard working people and we deserve it, but for next time we&#39;re debating between a longer Disney stay and some kind of cruise. (I&#39;m adverse to water and sun, so guess which way my vote goes.)</p>
