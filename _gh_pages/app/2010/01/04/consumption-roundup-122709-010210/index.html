<p>Just a few of the things I read, watched, whatever this week.</p>

<p><em>Online:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/12/28/discuss-how-many-ideas-do-you-show-clients/">How Many Ideas Do You Show Your Clients?</a></em> - Smashing - Graham Smith</strong>
A good article, especially for Smashing, about the importance of reading your client before you give them too many choices during the creative process; showing off our imaginations to the wrong person does nothing but serve our egos, but doing so to the right person can instill confidence. My favorite part, &quot;In my experience, we are getting lazy as communicators, trying to deal with all aspects of life — business and personal — via email and text messages.&quot; I see this daily, but I wouldn&#39;t fault e-mail -- I blame the lazy and inconsiderate author as well as the lazy and illiterate reader. It&#39;s important to communicate in a way you&#39;ll be understood, but communicating with the written word is hardly new and anyone can do it effectively if they make the effort.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>_<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pickle/">Time Management: The Pickle Jar Theory</a> _- A List Apart - Jeremy Wright</strong>
This one&#39;s been waiting to be read for at least a month because I couldn&#39;t find the time. It&#39;s a good read on establishing and addressing priority tasks and scheduling your day around those. It took me a while to come to one of the same conclusions that e-mails were rarely immediate problems and could be wound in between other to-do items.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em><a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/management/leadership/article204500.html">It Takes Leadership</a></em> - Entrepreneur</strong>** - Michael Sanibel**
Simply a great post that really hit home for me. I often reflect on the importance of leadership in a business environment and what goes awry when it&#39;s missing from the equation. So much in business and teams has to come from the top.</p></li>
<li><p><em>*<em><a href="http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15063872">Military use of consumer technology</a> - *</em></em><em><strong>The Econo</strong></em><strong>mist</strong>_
_I love The Economist -- I think it&#39;s one of the best producers of content around, but I wasn&#39;t under the impression that this was anything new. Wasn&#39;t Saddam rumored to have bought PlayStation 2 by the truckload for missile guidance a decade ago? I also thought that the public was given GPS from the military, not the other way around. Either way, interesting read.</p></li>

My wife and I just finished our month-long hiatus from TV, so I finally got to catch up on Joss Whedon&#39;s latest dumped-from-Fox-before-its-time show. _(A lot of people are still bitter about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/">Firefly</a>, and I&#39;m one of them.) _It really is a fantastic show and I&#39;m sad to see it go.</p></li>

I spent way too much time on this game over the week -- probably in the range of 10 hours or so. It&#39;s an incredible RPG that draws on a lot of sensibilities established in MMOs with a very engaging storyline.</p></li>

The bulk of my free time has been spent on a Ruby on Rails tutorial. I&#39;m really eager to learn more about the programming framework, but if the past has taught me anything, marathon cramming isn&#39;t the best way to retain large amounts of new information.</p></li>
