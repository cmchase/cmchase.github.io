<p>Just last week I was telling my team leader about my design process for difficult problems: I examine the task from all the angles I can, think about possible solutions and then I go do something else for a while. Luckily he didn&#39;t think me a lazy bastard and even knew what I meant by &quot;shower epiphanies&quot; - being struck with inspiration during moments of mental idleness (while driving, doing yardwork or in the shower).</p>

<p>It was a nice coincidenceÂ that I saw <em>Jonah Lehrer&#39;s <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/you-know-more-than-you-know/">You Know More Than You Know</a></em> this morning.</p>
