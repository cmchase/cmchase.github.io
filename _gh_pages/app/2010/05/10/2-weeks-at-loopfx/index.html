<p>The normal nerves that go with a new position have started to settle down now that I&#39;m going into my 3rd week at LoopFX. I&#39;m really happy to have joined the team; everyone is fantastic and the work is both gratifying and challenging. It&#39;s something of a change to go from client-work web development to online application development, but I don&#39;t think I could go back any time soon:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My &quot;client&quot; is the company I work for. There&#39;s a team of people that take pride in what what we do, which can be very motivating.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Normal&quot; client-work often included a lot of hand-holding, which I do not miss. Yeah, I still have to make sound arguments for my ideas but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever have to explain the difference between a search box and the browser&#39;s address field.</p></li>
<li><p>IE6 was a real factor in my client-work -- it still represented about 10% of the viewers. To my absolute delight, Loop does not support it. (Hell yeah!)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;ve largely spent my time redesigning a number of forms (still one of the more challenging parts of web design, if you ask me) as well as a few pages. I almost feel guilty with the amount of time and energy I&#39;ve gotten to put into the redesigns -- the client-work I did never afforded me the luxury of user interviews or extra design time to improve the experience. I think that speaks to the biggest difference I&#39;m seeing between client-work and app development: when presented with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">Triple Constraint</a> (Cost, Time and Quality), many clients focused on Cost alone, whereas Loop focuses on Quality and works with the constraints from there.</p>

<p>I really do love what I&#39;m doing and the people I do it with, yet there&#39;s something of a skill gap that I&#39;ve got to close. Everyone has been very understanding and helpful, but for the foreseeable future I&#39;ll be pushing myself to learnÂ  ASP.NET and C# (with some brushing up on jQuery for good measure).</p>
