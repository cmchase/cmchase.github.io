<p>Today I learned that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/03/amazon-and-barnes-noble-plan-to-ride-the-ipad-e-book-train.ars">Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble will be launching apps to support the iPad as an e-book reader</a>. I&#39;ve been secretly wanting an iPad (read: I haven&#39;t been bugging my wife yet), but this news puts me over the edge – now I <em>really</em> want an iPad.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s fantastic news that Amazon and B&amp;N have the wisdom to recognize that their core product (media) is where the money is, not the platforms they&#39;ve launched (Kindle &amp; Nook). I wonder what the conversations are like over at Apple – do they resent the competition with their iBook stuff or do they recognize that people like me are now more interested in the iPad platform?</p>

<p>So here I am, really, really eager for the iPad. Yeah, it&#39;s got some flaws, but it&#39;s a great e-reader solution as far as I can see. Right now I&#39;ve got <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/project1/">this great book that I&#39;ve been slogging through on Project Management</a>, but it&#39;s proven difficult because it&#39;s a PDF. I find my attention span wanes when I&#39;m trying to read from a monitor (I blame the internet) and reading on my iPod Touch is a bit laborious. Solution? $600 and a whole lot of pleading with my wife.</p>
