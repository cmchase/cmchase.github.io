	        <p>Not 18 hours after posting about <a href="/the-appointment-ledger-smells-funny/">a weird code smell</a>, we found a better solution to using NotificationCenter: exclusiveTouch. Actually, by &quot;we&quot; I mean &quot;John&quot;, the principal software developer I&#39;m working with for our lane application.</p>

	        <p>I recently posted about how <a href="/ios-brain-leak/">my brain leaks out all the Objective-C I know</a> if I go too long without using it, which is barely an exaggeration,  so I made some time in my day this past Friday to clear out a last-minute bug. In that same post, I mentioned how I feel in love with NSNotificationCenter, which I used to try to handle a bug where the UI gets all wonky if the the user taps the VIN Search button while the user had focus on the SearchBar. (I&#39;m simply disabling the VIN Search button until the SearchBar resigns first responder.)</p>

I feel like I put up a good fight when it comes to reigning... <em>ambitious</em>... ideas back down to earth, but some times they sneak something in during a review that I just can&#39;t deal well with.</p>

	        <p>My wife sent me a message today that read, &quot;Mia just pooped on the potty.&quot; Being that I&#39;m 1) stupid, and 2) a proud parent, I told my friends at the office to the expected amount of ambivalence. Samantha and I have joked about how odd it is that we casually talk about another human being&#39;s bodily functions, but now we&#39;re practically high-fiving each other because our daughter took a shit in a designated container. Parenthood turns otherwise reasonable people in real weirdos.</p>

	        <p>I went to the first-ever Front-End Design Conference Workshop to get some insight on how <a href="https://twitter.com/nickawalsh">@nickawalsh</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/drewbarontini">@drewbarontini</a> do things over at <a href="http://envylabs.com/">Envy Labs</a>. They were great! They kept things going at a good pace and were super-patient with my constant badgering. They laid out a lot of their processes and the thinking behind their methodologies; I don&#39;t agree with a couple of their approaches -- I&#39;m sure our opinions are colored by the stacks we work in (.NET vs. Rails) and team composition -- but seeing how they do things was invaluable.</p>

It covers the difficulties in raising a level-headed, freethinking daughter in a Disney Princess world. Gender typing is nothing new, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever been easy to grow up, whether for boys, girls and others in between, but reading this really opened my eyes to just how hard girls have it.</p>

	        <p>One day we were strolling through Target and I just about lost my mind. There was this stand, barely even noticeable, filled with little card stock packages. The display had a handful of different types, distinguishable by its own ring of high-saturated color. I grabbed one; it had a fantastic papery texture and exceptional minimalist design with bold, clear lettering, &quot;I have a blister.&quot;</p>

It&#39;s what makes commuting somewhat bearable; I&#39;ve taken hundreds of photos with its camera and it provides a hedonistic amount of entertainment; it&#39;s my alarm clock, my portable internet, and it&#39;s never more than 10 feet away.</p>

One of my favorite sections was in Chapter 8, &quot;<strong>Limits on Attention, Shape, Thought and Action</strong>&quot;, was about primary goals and cleanup steps.</p>

	        <p>Just last week I was telling my team leader about my design process for difficult problems: I examine the task from all the angles I can, think about possible solutions and then I go do something else for a while. Luckily he didn&#39;t think me a lazy bastard and even knew what I meant by &quot;shower epiphanies&quot; - being struck with inspiration during moments of mental idleness (while driving, doing yardwork or in the shower).</p>

	        <p>The normal nerves that go with a new position have started to settle down now that I&#39;m going into my 3rd week at LoopFX. I&#39;m really happy to have joined the team; everyone is fantastic and the work is both gratifying and challenging. It&#39;s something of a change to go from client-work web development to online application development, but I don&#39;t think I could go back any time soon:</p>

I&#39;d been with <a href="http://www.digitaleel.com/">Digital Eel, Inc</a> as a jack of all trades web designer/developer for just over 7 years -- they treated me very well and I was lucky to be a part of their  family -- so I feel like I&#39;m leaving behind a long history of familiarity and comfort.</p>

	        <p>I&#39;ve been taking an short break from digital productivity and I&#39;ve found it a bit difficult to get back into the &quot;work 12 hours a day&quot; mood. I absolutely love working on the web but I&#39;m sure most would agree that it&#39;s a lot of work to keep up with the industry. There really aren&#39;t enough hours in the day, which (in my weaker moments) leaves me feeling like throwing up my hands and getting off the grid altogether by moving into a woodland cabin.</p>

	        <p>When I was in the 10th grade, I had a science teacher by the name of Robert Evans. He was quirky and eccentric, as mandated by the state of Florida for all high school science teachers, but what really stuck with me was his love for the open-book test. (What also stuck was how he would bring in his guitar and play for us songs he wrote; it all sounded like the theme to &#39;Renegade&#39;).</p>

	        <p>I think one of the best ways to capture the interest of customers is to <em>gasp</em> <em>be interesting</em>. I know, it seems like a bunch of crap -- why would anyone want to <em>enjoy</em> reading what a company has to say? What would we do with all the dry, faceless corporate text that&#39;s out there? (Probably the same thing we&#39;re doing now; ignoring it.)</p>

	        <p>One of the very first things I learned about working in web design is that you have to find your own gratification. The boss can only pat you on the head so often and you&#39;d better not hold your breath waiting for every client to recognize how awesome you are. I won&#39;t say that I crank out award-winning web sites left and right. (It just wouldn&#39;t be honest and awards are rarely lauded on small-budget sites.) However, I will say that I do my best to take pride in what I do. Surprisingly, this can require some effort.</p>

I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m the first to come up with this, but it turned out to be pretty easy to do thanks to a huge oversight from the WordPress developers.</p>
