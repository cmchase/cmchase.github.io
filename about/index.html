	<h1>Hello.</h1>

	<p>My name is <strong>Cory Chase</strong>. I'm a husband and father living in St Pete, FL.</p>

	<p>I work as the Lead Web Developer at Loop Management, LLC where I manage a small team for the front-end development and user-interface design on a large web application.</p>

	<p>I do a lot of interface and interaction design; low-fidelity work in Balsamiq with Photoshop for my high-fidelity stuff.</p>

	<p>Most of my code work is in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and ASP.NET on C#. I've done a ton of work in PHP in the past, have had a good bit of exposure to Objective-C with our first iOS app release, and had a brief run-in with Rails.</p>
