<h1>Oh, hey</h1>

<p>I'm Cory Chase and I'm the lead web developer for Loop Management in Clearwater, FL. I handle the administrative front-end stuff for a large web application and generally keep software engineers from making terrible, terrible design decisions.</p>

<p>I've been professionally active in the industry since early 2003 but, like many, I got my start in the late 90's with things better left forgotten on Geocities and Angelfire.</p>

<p>I tend to focus front-end design. I've got tons of experience with Photoshop, HTML, PHP, CSS and jQuery, but these days I find myself looking at C# and ASP.NET more than I'd have ever thought. At the end of the day, interfaces and user experience are what float my boat.</p>

<p>To be honest, this blog is meant to help me flex my writing muscles and I don't expect others to get a lot out of what I have to say, but I can be contacted at <a href="mailto:cmchase@gmail.com?subject=CoryChase.com Question">cmchase@gmail.com</a>.</p>
