In about 12 hours I start my new position as a web developer with the engineering team at [Loop Management, LLC](http://www.loopfx.com/). I'd been with [Digital Eel, Inc](http://www.digitaleel.com/) as a jack of all trades web designer/developer for just over 7 years -- they treated me very well and I was lucky to be a part of their  family -- so I feel like I'm leaving behind a long history of familiarity and comfort.

I'm very excited about learning new things and meeting new people -- overall I'm extremely grateful  for the opportunity, but I'm still a bit nervous -- 7 years is a long time, especially in the tech/knowledge industry, so I worry about a bunch of stuff:



	
  * What kind of skill gaps do I have? Will I be thrown to the fire? Will I be over-coddled?

	
  * What if I say the wrong thing and upset someone? Will I be branded for life as a jerk?

	
  * What if any of the millions of little habits I've developed over the years is a taboo there? Are headphones considered rude? Is it bad form to surf for tech news during lunch?


The list really goes on (and becomes more inane as it does), but I fear that I won't be getting much sleep tonight.
