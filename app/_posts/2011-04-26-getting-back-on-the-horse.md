Today marks my 1-year anniversary with Loop and I feel like I've learned a lot, some of which I'll eventually write about. There have been a number of changes in my life, with more on the way, and I finally feel ready to (cautiously) jump back into my social media dabblings.

Last February I unintentionally put off some coworkers with [this post](/it-takes-a-village/). (In hindsight, I could have sung my praises for Dan in a better way.) I feel that the awkward conversations that followed help clear things up in the office, but they also led to my immediate abandonment of Twitter (of my own volition) and a decreased interest in blogging.

Much to my detriment.

There's a lot to gain from putting yourself out there and I plan on taking advantage of it once again, but I'm feeling pretty mindful of the experience I had and of the poor examples other [people](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/14/gilbert-gottfried-tweets-_n_835553.html) /[companies](http://mashable.com/2011/03/09/chrysler-drops-the-f-bomb-on-twitter/) provide. My only concerns are; 1) time, and 2) letting myself fall into the gamification of social media -- I don't want the number of comments/followers/retweets/whatevers to become the justification of any renewed efforts. I recognize that there's a lot to gain from competitiveness and popularity, but it just feels disingenuous to who I am...
