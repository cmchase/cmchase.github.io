I haven't got much of a post this week as things have been hectic, but a [YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZRxBtZLeUY) recently caught my attention.


While The Flintstones wasn't explicitly meant for children in its time, it undoubtedly attracted younger viewers, and this ad most certainly helped encourage kids to smoke. (Not necessarily right away, but most seeds eventually grow.)

Tobacco has had its marketing restrictions steadily tighten since the 60's, but what other things are advertisers _incidentally_ selling kids on these days? Eating habits? Future buying behaviors? I'd love to hear input on the topic.
