Did you ever play that game, "_What would your porn name be?_" It's easy: just take the name of your childhood pet (we had a big dog named Toby) and append the street you grew up on (I grew up on Sherwood Circle). _Toby Sherwood_? Perfect!

Unfortunately for me, a young woman must have had a cat named "Cory", grew up on "Chase Drive" or something, and happened to go pro.


## Pornography is a Big Deal


In case you didn't know, porn is why VHS won over Beta and and a big contributor to the rapid growth of the internet ([CNN Article](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/04/23/porn.technology/index.html?hpt=Sbin)).

I won't knock porn -- if prostitution is the oldest profession, then voyeurism is the oldest hobby. Unlike prostitution, the adult entertainment industry doesn't bring drugs or crime into neighborhoods. I'm sure it's got faults, but I've never seen a porn star crawling home at 6am while I drive into work.

I'm largely indifferent about porn -- I neither consume nor take offense, even when a porn star goes by my given name.


## Namespace Collision


A few months ago, "Cory Chase" contacted me and asked to buy this domain. She was building a new site and, like any business person, wanted a good address for it. I respectfully declined, and she was very cordial despite her disappointment. She even joked that it must be weird that a porn actress shares my name.

Yeah, it's a little weird, but what's the big deal? If a client or employer gets put off by the coincidence then we're probably not a good fit. It's not like creepy guys are confusing "Cory Chase" the web developer and "Cory Chase" the actress.


## Then a Creepy Guy Confused Us

I've gotten some weird messages in my gmail account. I guess there are a lot of cmchase's out there -- I've gotten birthday wishes from grandmothers, church announcements, university memos and even an account or two registered with my email address. I do my best to let senders (or system admins) know about the mistake and we all move on with our lives. I think it's kind of interesting -- you know, voyeuristic -- to get a peak into a stranger's life like that.

But not so with the message from last Thursday where I got a little too much information about the kind of stuff "Cory Chase" has to deal with. Here's the message but, out of respect for (and fear of retribution from) the creepy guy I'll withhold his name:


> Hi

i have seen your videos and was wondering if you could smother my face with your ass and squirt all over me with your sexy p***y. i would also love it if you could tease the sh*t out of me by grinding on my d*ck ob me and hand job and blow job but not letting me cum. light ballsqueezes would also be nice


I just happened to be checking my email in a crowded elevator when I saw this. I'm not really one to care what strangers think of me, but I discreetly turned off my phone display.

3 reasons I knew this wasn't meant for me:



	
  1. I didn't recognize the sender. I wouldn't put it past a friend to goof on me like this, especially with a CC to my wife.

	
  2. There aren't any videos of me floating around, unless you count the ones of me playing with my daughter, in which case this guy's an even bigger creeper.

	
  3. I don't have a vagina, putting that second request out of the question.


I showed the message to my wife and we joked about sending a reply, but thinking about the type of person that would send this message gave me pause. What did he expect in response? What's with the polite greeting? The "i would also love it" (sic) part seems like a sincere invitation -- is that his intention? Replying to him, whether in earnest or jest, probably would have gotten weird really fast.

However, my absolute favorite part is that last sentence. It's so casual and shameless -- it almost seems innocent in tone. It's like when you're running to the store and someone says, "Oh, and pick up some milk."

I hope "Cory Chase" has a long and successful career in porn. Sharing names might make for an interesting conversation for me once in a while, but that's nothing compared to the kind of attention I'm sure she gets.
