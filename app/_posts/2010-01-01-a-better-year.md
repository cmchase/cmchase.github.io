I'm not one for making New Year's Resolutions, but I've been doing a lot of navel gazing the past few months and I may as well articulate a conclusion I came to.

I'm not out to quit a vice, exercise more, donate more blood or whatever's itemized on some list pinned up on the fridge. Lists are fine things, they help me function on a daily basis, but my big goal for the foreseeable future isn't something I can put to paper with a little checkbox for motivation's sake.

_I want to be better._
