_Some of the things I enjoyed over the past week:_


### Online Reading:
	
  * **_[Think Like Me, Agree With Me](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/12/think-like-me-agree-with-me.html)_ - Seth Godin**
Nice, short read on persuasion and perspective.

  * **_[Trident Gum Turns Fan Tweets into Full-Page USA Today Ad](http://mashable.com/2009/12/18/trident-layers-twitter-ad/)_ - Mashable**
Bold, full-page USA Today advertisement for Trident's new gum. (I have a pack of this in my car. It tastes good for all of 30 seconds and seems too sugary to me.)

	
  * **[A List Apart's 2009 Web Professional Survey](http://aneventapart.com/webdesignsurvey/)**
Technically, it's not reading but this is a good link to include. If you're in the business of making web sites, and haven't taken it yet, then you might want to spend 5-10 minutes to pitch in.

	
  * **_[What Does Quality Mean To You?](http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2009/12/what-does-quality-mean-to-you.html)_ - Obie Fernandez**
A nice inside look into the minds over at Hashrocket. I'd agree with the popular conclusion of "Craftsmanship".

	
  * **_[Needs + Resources + Location + Schedule + Budget = Scope](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/12/needs-resources-location-schedule-budget-scope.php)_ -Â  Whitney Hess**
I think I read this one on UX Matters the previous week, but I won't go splitting hairs. Whitney is a fantastic writer and I got a lot out of this article.



### Offline Reading:


	
  * **["Winning With People"](http://www.amazon.com/Winning-People-Discover-Principles-Every/dp/0785260897) - John C. Maxwell**
I finished this book during the week. The first two-thirds were great, but I had to force myself through the rest of the book. At times it was overly-pendantic and quote-driven, but for the most part it was a good read on the value of relationships.

  * **[Eclipse (The Twilight Saga)](http://www.amazon.com/Eclipse-Twilight-Saga-Stephenie-Meyer/dp/0316027650/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1261342594&sr=1-2) - Stephanie Meyer**
I also finished the third in the series. (Small accomplishment; these titles are super-fast reads.) I began reading these at my wife's recommendation (read: command) and this is by far the best written so far. I suffered through far less teen romance this time, which was a pleasant surprise because it's one of the few aspects I dislike about the stories. (I still prefer the Harry Potter stuff when it comes to Children's/Young Adult lit.)
